# EDM Shuffle - Prioritized Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap prioritizes implementation based on impact vs effort, focusing on critical path items that block shipping/performance (P1), followed by feature uplift (P2), and finally nice-to-haves (P3). Priorities are based on the gap analysis and strategic objectives outlined in the project documentation.

## P1 (NOW) - Critical Path: Shipping & Performance

### 1.1 Web Audio Engine Implementation
**Problem**: Core user experience cannot function without proper audio engine. Current UI components (FLX10Deck, LiveEqualizer, SoundPackLoader) exist but have no real Web Audio API integration - audio is simulated/non-functional.

**Proposed Fix**: Implement complete Web Audio API engine with dual-deck mixing, crossfading, pitch control, echo effects, real-time waveform visualization, and mobile-optimized performance. Connect audio context, nodes, and real-time processing to existing UI components.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Real audio playback on both decks A/B with independent controls
- Functional crossfader with smooth audio transitions
- Pitch control and echo effects that actually modify audio
- Real-time waveform visualization linked to live frequency data
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox)
- Mobile touch controls and responsive design
- Simulation mode with clear UI indicators when audio fails

**Tests to Add**:
- Unit tests for audio engine core functionality
- E2E tests for deck controls and mixing workflow
- Cross-browser compatibility tests
- Mobile touch interaction tests
- Audio context lifecycle tests

**Rollback Plan**:
- Revert to simulation mode with visual-only feedback
- Maintain existing UI components without audio functionality
- Preserve user preferences and settings
- Graceful degradation to placeholder audio system

**Est. Effort**: 3-4 weeks (High complexity, critical path)
