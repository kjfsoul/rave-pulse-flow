# IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md

This file defines the **exhaustive implementation roadmap** for EDM Shuffle, divided into microtasks and phases. It is designed for collaboration between Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and other contributing LLMs. **All contributors must adhere to these microtasks in the defined sequence unless explicitly approved to deviate.**

## CORE RULES FOR ALL LLMs
- **No fabricated claims of completion.**
- **No placeholder data or mock implementations** unless explicitly commented and explained.
- **If a task is not implementable**, say so honestly and provide alternatives or request human support.
- **Each task should include TODO comments**, areas for completion, and inline annotations.
- **Gemini CLI must be utilized** for real-time TypeScript validation, dependency management, and file updates wherever possible.
- **Claude must cross-reference active task progress** with CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md at every commit stage.

[...truncated for brevity; see last approved version in chat for full roadmap...]
