  +# Architectural Decision Records
  +
  +This file logs significant architectural decisions for the project.
  +
  +## ADR-001: Codebase Hygiene - Archive Unused Scripts and Notes
  +
  +Date: 2025-08-30
  +
  +Status: Proposed
  +
  +Context: The root directory contained numerous scripts and documentation files that were not part
  of the application's build or runtime. This cluttered the project and made it difficult to
  navigate.
  +
  +Decision:
  +- Relocate one-off test scripts (quick-test.js, test-rss-*.js, verify-connection.js) to an attic/
  directory to preserve them for historical reference without cluttering the root.
  +- Move developer notes and agent instructions (claude_code_instructions.md, GEMINI.md) to a
  docs/dev/ directory to centralize development-related documentation.
  +- Consolidate tests from the deprecated src/test directory into src/__tests__.
  +
  +Consequences: The project root is cleaner. All application code, tests, and documentation are now
  in their conventional locations.
