# EDM Shuffle - Agentic AI Integration

## Overview

This document outlines the agentic AI integration architecture for the EDM Shuffle platform, focusing on Claude Code as the Implementer and Manus.ai as the Orchestrator, with optional MCP and local tools for enhanced capabilities.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **Claude Code (Implementer)**
   - **Input**: Work Order YAML files
   - **Output**: Unified diffs + tests + CHANGELOG
   - **Role**: Executes implementation tasks with code generation and modification

2. **Manus.ai (Orchestrator)**
   - **Input**: GitHub tickets and work orders
   - **Output**: PR creation, CI gate enforcement
   - **Role**: Watches tickets, calls Implementer, manages workflow

3. **MCP/Local Tools**
   - Code search/index tools
   - Test generators
   - Security/audit tools
   - Performance analyzers

## Integration Workflow

### 1. Work Order Creation

```yaml
# Example Work Order Structure
id: "audio-latency-fix-001"
branch: "feature/audio-latency-fix"
target_files: 
  - "src/components/audio-ui/"
  - "src/hooks/"
objective: "Fix mobile audio latency issues"
acceptance_criteria:
  - "Latency reduced to <100ms on mobile devices"
  - "Cross-browser compatibility maintained"
  - "No regression in desktop performance"
```

### 2. Manus.ai Orchestration

1. **Ticket Monitoring**: Watches GitHub issues for tagged work items
2. **Work Order Generation**: Converts tickets to YAML work orders
3. **Implementer Assignment**: Routes work orders to Claude Code
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors implementation progress
5. **PR Management**: Creates pull requests with proper CI gates
6. **Quality Assurance**: Enforces testing and review requirements

### 3. Claude Code Implementation

1. **Work Order Parsing**: Reads and validates YAML work orders
2. **Code Analysis**: Examines existing codebase structure
3. **Implementation**: Generates unified diffs for changes
4. **Test Generation**: Creates comprehensive test suites
5. **Documentation**: Updates CHANGELOG and relevant docs
6. **Validation**: Ensures all acceptance criteria are met

## Safety Rails

### 1. Security Constraints
- **No Secrets**: All configurations must be non-secret placeholders
- **Small Diffs**: Changes limited to focused, manageable sizes
- **CI Required**: All changes must pass automated checks
- **Code Review**: Mandatory human review for all AI-generated code

### 2. Quality Gates
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% test coverage required
- **Linting**: All linting rules must pass
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript compilation required
- **Performance**: No performance regression allowed

### 3. Operational Constraints
- **Branch Strategy**: Feature branches only, no direct main branch changes
- **Change Size**: Maximum 500 lines per work order
- **Rollback Plan**: Each work order must include rollback instructions
- **Monitoring**: All changes must include monitoring hooks

## Tool Integration

### Code Search/Index Tools
- **Ripgrep**: Fast code search across the codebase
- **Ctags**: Code navigation and symbol indexing
- **Comby**: Structural code search and replacement

### Test Generation Tools
- **Vitest**: Unit test generation for TypeScript/React
- **Playwright**: E2E test generation for user flows
- **Testing Library**: Component testing utilities

### Security/Audit Tools
- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Lockfile-lint**: Lockfile validation and security
- **ESLint**: Code quality and security rule checking

### Performance Tools
- **Vite Plugin Analysis**: Bundle optimization insights
- **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility scoring
- **Web Vitals**: Core web metrics monitoring

## Configuration Files

### agents/registry.json
- Lists available agents and their capabilities
- Non-secret configuration for agent discovery
- Maps agent names to implementation roles

### agents/config.yaml
- Runtime configuration for agent execution
- Tool selection and parameter settings
- Safety and constraint definitions

### docs/WORK_ORDER.schema.yaml
- Schema definition for work order YAML files
- Validation rules and required fields
- Example work orders for reference

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Work Order Definition
1. Create YAML work order based on schema
2. Define acceptance criteria and constraints
3. Specify target files and objectives
4. Include test plan and rollback strategy

### Step 2: Agent Assignment
1. Manus.ai reviews work order
2. Assigns to appropriate Claude Code instance
3. Sets up monitoring and tracking
4. Validates work order completeness

### Step 3: Implementation Execution
1. Claude Code parses work order
2. Analyzes existing codebase
3. Generates implementation diffs
4. Creates tests and documentation
5. Validates against acceptance criteria

### Step 4: Quality Assurance
1. Automated test execution
2. Security scanning
3. Performance validation
4. Code review preparation

### Step 5: Deployment Preparation
1. Pull request creation
2. CI pipeline execution
3. Review and approval
4. Merge and deployment

## Monitoring and Observability

### Success Metrics
- **Implementation Success Rate**: Percentage of work orders completed successfully
- **Code Quality Score**: Based on test coverage and linting results
- **Performance Impact**: Change in application performance metrics
- **Bug Introduction Rate**: Number of regressions per implementation

### Alerting
- **Implementation Failures**: Notifications for failed work orders
- **Quality Gate Violations**: Alerts for test coverage or linting issues
- **Performance Regressions**: Warnings for performance degradation
- **Security Issues**: Immediate alerts for vulnerability findings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Work Order Validation Failures**
   - Check YAML syntax and schema compliance
   - Verify required fields are present
   - Ensure acceptance criteria are specific

2. **Implementation Timeouts**
   - Break large work orders into smaller pieces
   - Increase timeout limits for complex changes
   - Optimize tool performance

3. **Test Failures**
   - Review test generation quality
   - Ensure tests cover acceptance criteria
   - Validate test environment setup

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Rollback Implementation**: Use predefined rollback strategies
2. **Work Order Retry**: Retry failed implementations with adjusted parameters
3. **Manual Intervention**: Escalate to human developers for complex issues

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Integrations
- **Advanced AI Models**: Integration with newer AI capabilities
- **Enhanced Testing**: AI-powered test optimization
- **Performance Optimization**: Automated performance tuning
- **Security Enhancement**: Advanced vulnerability detection

### Scaling Considerations
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple concurrent work order executions
- **Distributed Agents**: Agent distribution across resources
- **Caching**: Implementation result caching for common patterns
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent work order distribution
