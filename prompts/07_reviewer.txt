Act as strict reviewer. Given PLAN + DIFF PREVIEW, evaluate:

- Spec adherence (no scope creep)
- Types & API stability (TS strict; no breaking exports unless specified)
- Tests (unit + edge cases; e2e covers main user flow)
- Security (no secrets; parameterized queries; Supabase RLS-safe)
- Performance (no N+1; memoization where needed; bundle size)
- Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard nav, contrast)
- Repo rules compliance (PROJECT_RULES.md, .cursorrules)

Return:
- PASS or CHANGES-REQUESTED
- Bulleted fixes (actionable)
- If PASS: final PR title/body + merge checklist
