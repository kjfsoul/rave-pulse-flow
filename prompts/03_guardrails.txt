Execute Stage 1 as a DIFF PREVIEW only (no writes). Output unified diffs for:

- PROJECT_RULES.md: coding standards; error handling & logging; Supabase usage (typed clients, RLS); API versioning; perf budgets; a11y checklist; commit conventions; PR size limits; branching model.
- ACCEPTANCE_CHECKLIST.md: gates (typecheck, lint, unit, e2e, size-limit); tests required; no public API changes unless specified; security: secrets, parameterized queries.
- .cursorrules: enforced libs/patterns/naming and do/don’t rules for assistants.
- .editorconfig, .prettierrc, .eslintrc.js (TS/React/import/order rules), tsconfig.json (strict).
- .github/workflows/*.yml:
  - typecheck.yml, lint.yml, test.yml (Vitest/Jest), e2e.yml (Playwright skeleton), size-limit.yml, supabase-diff.yml (runs `npx supabase db diff --local` and fails on unexpected drift).

Also show the npm script additions to package.json:
"typecheck", "lint", "format", "test", "e2e", "build", "size", "index:code", "index:components", "ci:all".

Finally, print PR title/description and say: “AWAITING APPLY APPROVAL”.
