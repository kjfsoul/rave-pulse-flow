Propose a Hygiene PR (diff preview only):
- For each candidate dead file identified, choose:
  - Move to attic/  OR  git rm
- Include justification per file: no inbound imports, not used by build/tests/CI, replaced by <path> at commit <hash>.
- Update DECISIONS.md with "Removed/Archived" entries (path, reason, PR link placeholder).
- Update any imports to avoid build breaks; add unit tests if required.
- Keep PR within small-diff limits; split if needed.

Output: unified diff preview, PR title/description, rollback plan. End with “AWAITING APPLY APPROVAL”.
