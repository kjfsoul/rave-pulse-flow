# CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md

- Never fabricate or claim completion of features you cannot verify.
- Do not use placeholder/mock data unless clearly marked and with TODO for real code.
- Admit limitations honestly; recommend tools or human input if blocked.
- Validate and test every change; log issues in the change log.
- Reference IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md at every commit/review stage.
