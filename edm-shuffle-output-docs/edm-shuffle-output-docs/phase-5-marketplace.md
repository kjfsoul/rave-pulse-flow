<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 5: Marketplace -->

The marketplace is currently a static display with no functional e-commerce or inventory management.
5.1 Payments Integration (Stripe/Other)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. Despite claims in documentation, the "Harsh Reality" assessment and your review explicitly state "no payment processing despite Stripe integration claims" and "no Stripe payment integration at all".
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement Stripe or another payment gateway for real transaction processing.
5.2 Product Listings & Inventory Management
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Static). "Gear Drops of the Day" carousel and product boxes are visually present with fake items. While user-submitted outfit galleries exist on the old site, the new project has no actual marketplace functionality.
What Needs to be Addressed: Enable real product listings and an inventory management system, including support for both physical and digital items, and potentially user-to-user trading.
5.3 Order Confirmation, Digital Downloads, Gift Flows
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. These post-purchase functionalities are not implemented.
What Needs to be Addressed: Develop comprehensive order confirmation, digital download delivery, and gift flows.
