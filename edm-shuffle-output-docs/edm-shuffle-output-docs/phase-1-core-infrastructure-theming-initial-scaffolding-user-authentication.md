<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 1: Core Infrastructure & Theming (Initial Scaffolding & User Authentication) -->

Goal: Establish the foundational UI, visual theme, and core user authentication.
Completed Requirements:
Basic React + TypeScript + Tailwind setup with shadcn/ui components.
Enhanced Dark Theme with neon color palette (purple/cyan/bass-blue gradients) and custom CSS for glow effects, shimmer, and neon utility classes.
Framer Motion installed for smooth transitions, custom keyframes for equalizer, floating elements, glow effects, and scroll-triggered animations.
Pages scaffolded: Home, Archetype Quiz, Shuffle Feed, Marketplace Grid, Festival Voting Stage.
Bottom navigation bar with glowing icons (Explore, Challenges, Marketplace, Festival).
Reusable UI components like NeonButton, GlowCard, EqualizerBars, and FloatingElements (sneakers, particles).
Homepage with kinetic festival visuals, PLUR orbs, floating sneakers animation, and a "Find Your Shuffle Archetype" CTA.
Archetype Quiz transformed into an immersive cosmic portal experience with multi-step animations, dynamic aura meter, ceremonial reveals, and artist spotlights.
Basic user authentication flow with Supabase (sign up, login, email/password reset, user profile).
Still Pending/Needs Real Work:
Hero / Homepage: Sound not interactive, equalizer not synced, PLUR orbs don't serve a function beyond visual styling.
Archetype Quiz: No connection to feed logic; quiz is still gating, not enhancing overall experience. Archetype selection needs to truly impact site theme/user experience and unlock special content.
Crucially, ensure all audio feedback claimed in prompt updates is actually functional and not simulated (e.g., sound for equalizer, turbtables).
Validation: Verify visual fidelity, responsive design, and basic UI interactivity. For authentication, ensure successful user registration, login, and profile display with real (Supabase) data.
