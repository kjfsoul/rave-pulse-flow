<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = REALITY AUDIT / PLACEHOLDER DISCLOSURE -->

Any placeholder, simulation, or unfinished feature MUST be logged here with a TODO note.
If a feature was claimed but not truly delivered, roll back the status and log the rollback here.
Example:
- DJMixStation.tsx - Crossfader - Claimed ✅ but found ⚠️: Visual only, no audible effect. Rolled back status to In Progress. // TODO: Implement real Web Audio API GainNode routing.
