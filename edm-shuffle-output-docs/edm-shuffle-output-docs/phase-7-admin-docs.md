<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 7: Admin + Docs -->

This phase is critical for the project's long-term manageability and integrity but remains largely unimplemented.
7.1 Integrated Admin Dashboard
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. An admin dashboard is not implemented.
What Needs to be Addressed: Build a comprehensive admin dashboard with role-based access for content, user, event, and product management.
7.2 Documentation Pipeline: Root Directory + Microtask Enforcement
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Needs Update). Various documentation files exist (e.g., project_overview.md, technical_architecture.md). However, maintaining consistency and accuracy between claims and reality has been a recurring issue.
What Needs to be Addressed: Continuously update all project documentation to accurately reflect the current state of features, and enforce consistent adherence to the documentation pipeline for all development tasks.
7.3 Integrity & Compliance Automation
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Conceptual). Integrity rules for LLMs (e.g., no placeholders without labels) have been defined, and tools like Gemini CLI are planned for validation. However, the automated enforcement of these principles is not yet fully in place.
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement automated testing (Jest/Playwright) and establish a CI/CD pipeline (Netlify/Vercel) to ensure consistent quality and functionality.
7.4 Periodic Masterplan & FRS Review
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Functional Requirements Spec (FRS) are high-priority but were noted as "NOT YET WRITTEN".
What Needs to be Addressed: Establish a process for regular review and update of the Masterplan and FRS to align with actual development progress and evolving requirements.
