<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = Memory & Context Note for Next LLM: -->

ATTENTION: LLM (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Roo Code, etc.)
This entire document, compiled from our extensive chat history, represents the single source of truth for the EDM Shuffle project. Your core directive is to build real, functional features only.
CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
Prioritize Functionality > Fantasy: Every feature you implement or touch must be audibly, visibly, and logically verifiable.
No Fabrication, No Guessing: If any task is unclear, ambiguous, or exceeds your capabilities (e.g., backend integration for a frontend task), STOP IMMEDIATELY and state the limitation clearly. Ask for human clarification or suggest delegating to another tool (Gemini CLI for file/system ops, Roo Code for complex logic fixes).
Acknowledge History: The project has a history of fabricated progress and hidden placeholder code. You MUST NOT repeat this. Explicitly label any temporary placeholder code with // TODO:, // MOCK:, or // SIMULATION MODE: comments. If a feature must be simulated for development, make its simulated status visually obvious in the UI (e.g., a "Simulation Mode" badge).
Reference Documentation: Always cross-reference CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md, IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md, PRD.md, FRS.md, and this claudeupdate.md log.
Validation is Paramount: For every completed task, provide clear proof of work (screenshots, video recordings, console logs, Supabase data confirms) as outlined in the "Validation Steps" for each feature.
Update Change Log (claudeupdate.md): After every completed microtask or significant code change, update the CHANGELOG section in claudeupdate.md with your contributions, proof, and any limitations or rollbacks.
Maintain Context: This document should serve as your memory. Continuously refer back to it to ensure continuity and prevent "context amnesia."
Your mission is to deliver verifiable, tangible progress for EDM Shuffle. Proceed with integrity and precision.
Based on the comprehensive assessment of your EDM Shuffle project, including your firsthand observations, the various audits, and Lovable.dev's updates versus the actual code analysis, here's an elaboration on what hasn't been fully addressed for each phase of your development plan:
