<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 4: Challenges & Social -->

The challenge feed is largely a visual placeholder, lacking dynamic content and user submission capabilities.
4.1 Dynamic Challenge Feed (Backend/API & Frontend Integration)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The ShuffleFeed page exists visually with elements like "trending shuffle clips" and "challenge tags", and video tiles show visual enhancements. However, there is no actual content feed, and actions like "Remix This" are "just buttons" without underlying logic. A forensic audit found no ShuffleFeed components in the provided files.
What Needs to be Addressed: Hook up the challenge feed to a backend to fetch dynamic content. This requires creating a challenge table and API endpoints for listing and filtering challenges.
4.2 Challenge Submission Flow (File Upload, Caption, Squad Tagging)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no actual mechanism for users to upload files, add captions, or tag squads for challenge submissions.
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement a full challenge submission flow that includes file upload capabilities and metadata tagging.
4.3 PLUR Leaderboard & Challenge Winners
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Visual Only). A "PLURstreak System" and a visual leaderboard are present. However, this is not based on real data or gamification logic.
What Needs to be Addressed: Integrate a real leaderboard that dynamically updates based on challenge completions and "PLUR" points, and implement logic for determining and showcasing challenge winners.
