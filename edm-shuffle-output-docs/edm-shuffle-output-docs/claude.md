<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Claude, read this file first! -->
# CLAUDE.md

Welcome to EDM Shuffle development. This directory is optimized for LLM/Claude workflows.
- Always read `CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md` before coding.
- Never fabricate features, data, or progress.
- Ask for clarification if context is missing.
- See `documentation_index.md` for all documentation files.
