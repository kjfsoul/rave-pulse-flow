<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 6: Community & Crews -->

While basic community features (forums) exist on the original EDMShuffle.com, the advanced social and "crew" features for the new project are largely undeveloped.
6.1 Live Chat System (Real-Time Messaging)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Fake). A "Festival Lounge" with a "fake chat feed" of pre-seeded messages is visually present.
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement a real-time live chat system, including private and group channels.
6.2 Squad/Fam Features (Creation, Management, Invites)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Placeholder/Visual). A "PLURcrew Builder Sidebar" with visual avatar cards and slots exists. The Archetype Quiz is meant to tie into this, but the crew system is a placeholder and not interactive. The "Avatar Summon System" is client-side only.
What Needs to be Addressed: Develop a gamified squad/crew system with actual creation, management, invitations, member actions, and inter-squad events.
6.3 Commenting System
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Fake). Your review notes "just comments that are kind of feeding through probably presumably people Commenting".
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement a functional commenting system for user-generated content and platform features.
