<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 8: Built-in Marketing Framework -->

This phase is almost entirely unaddressed in terms of current implementation.
8.1 Integrated Marketing Dashboard
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. A marketing dashboard is not implemented.
What Needs to be Addressed: Develop a role-protected marketing dashboard to manage campaign creation, scheduling, and distribution across platforms.
8.2 Content Generation & Library
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. While AI-generated content and autonomous content curation are part of the vision, the autonomous agents designed to deliver this are not deployed live and only produce fake output.
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement content generation capabilities leveraging LLM endpoints and build a library for generated assets. This is contingent on the core backend and agent functionality being established.
8.3 Marketing Best Practices, Failsafes, & Innovation
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. While marketing strategies are outlined, the implementation of automation (n8n), approval workflows, and analytics integration within the platform itself is missing.
What Needs to be Addressed: Build out the automation integration and workflow processes within the marketing dashboard to support effective content deployment and monitoring.
In summary, while EDM Shuffle has a visually appealing frontend and a clear vision, most of the core functional requirements across all phases, particularly backend integrations, real-time interactivity, and the full implementation of AI/agent-driven features, are still either non-existent, simulated, or only partially implemented cosmetically. The project is currently recognized as being far from its MVP state due to these fundamental gaps.
