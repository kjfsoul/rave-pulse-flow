<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 1: User Authentication & Account System (Full User Journey) -->

This phase is critically unaddressed and represents a fundamental gap in your current implementation. Without proper authentication, features like personalized content, voting, and community interactions cannot be fully realized or persist for users.
1.1 User Registration & Login (Supabase)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no signup or login functionality on the live site. While a Supabase schema exists, it is not connected to any functional features.
What Needs to be Addressed: You need to implement basic user authentication and properly connect your React frontend to Supabase for user registration and login.
1.2 OAuth Integration (Google/Discord)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. OAuth integration for social logins is currently not implemented.
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement OAuth providers like Google or Discord within the user authentication flow, ensuring clear user feedback.
1.3 Email: Password Reset (Forgot Password)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no password reset flow available.
What Needs to be Addressed: Build a fully functional email-based password reset process, including verification and in-app confirmation.
1.4 Profile Management: Update Display Name, Email, Password
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There are no persistent user profiles where users can manage their details.
What Needs to be Addressed: Develop comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for user profile data.
1.5 Account Deletion & Data Export
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. This feature has not been mentioned or implemented.
What Needs to be Addressed: Although not explicitly detailed in the current plan, this is a standard requirement for user data privacy and management.
