<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = PHASE 2: Audio Engine & Mix Station -->

While significant visual components for the DJ Mix Station are present, the core audio functionality remains largely simulated or non-existent. This is a major discrepancy between Lovable.dev's claims and the actual state.
2.1 Core Audio Engine (Web Audio API)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. Despite claims of "Real Audio Features" and "Web Audio API Integration", your direct observation confirms "no sound" and "no real music" on the site. The forensic audit found no actual <audio> elements or src attributes for playing MP3s. Audio context infrastructure exists but doesn't consistently start sound.
What Needs to be Addressed: The absolute priority is to implement a true Web Audio API engine that produces audible sound, with reliable playback that persists across navigation.
2.2 DJ Deck Controls (Play/Pause, Volume, Pitch, Crossfader, Echo FX)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Cosmetic). The UI for turntables and controls is present. However, your review notes that "scratch" and "echo" buttons only "animate visually but do nothing". The "Drop My Set" button triggers confetti but lacks true dual-track mixing. While Lovable claimed real crossfading, pitch shifting, and echo effects, the forensic audit indicates that turntables only "tweak a number" without real audio effects or drag functionality.
What Needs to be Addressed: All deck buttons must be made truly functional and interactive, enabling independent control over track playback, volume, and BPM for both Deck A and Deck B. This includes implementing the actual audio processing for crossfading, pitch, and echo effects.
2.3 Waveform & BPM Visualization
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. While "Enhanced Equalizer" and "Real-time BPM Display" were claimed, the equalizer bar is not wired to BPM and is likely static. Your review confirmed a graphic "looks like bars that are playing something there is no sound".
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement a live waveform visualizer and BPM display using the Web Audio API AnalyserNode, ensuring it reflects real audio data and animates in sync with the music.
2.4 Track Loading & Management (local files first, streaming caveats)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The app primarily uses hardcoded tracks or placeholder URLs. While "Real Track Loading" was claimed, the system for loading different audio files is not truly implemented, and the goal of integrating with streaming apps like Spotify is blocked by API constraints (no direct audio access).
What Needs to be Addressed: Implement backend or local logic for managing tracks and assigning them to archetypes. Focus on local file support for DJing.
2.5 Innovative Audio Enhancements (Dynamic EQ, Visual Feedback, Headphone Cueing, etc.)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Visual Feedback Only). Visual feedback on controls exists. Other enhancements like Dynamic EQ or Headphone Cueing are not yet implemented or detailed.
What Needs to be Addressed: These features represent further polish and would be built once the core audio engine is stable and fully functional.
