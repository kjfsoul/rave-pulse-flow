<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = 8. Change Log (claudeupdate.md) -->

This file is the required status ledger for all contributors (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Roo Code, and humans). It must be updated at the end of every completed microtask, feature commit, bugfix, or agent hand-off. No feature is marked “complete” until it is proven, tested, and commented in this log.
If any claimed progress is found to be non-functional, it must be logged and rolled back here.
