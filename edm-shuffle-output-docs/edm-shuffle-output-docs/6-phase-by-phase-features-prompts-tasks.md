<!-- LLM/Claude Context: Section = 6. Phase-by-phase Features/Prompts/Tasks -->

(This section details each task with specific LLM prompts and validation steps. Due to the length, only a sample is shown here. The full content will be in the COMPREHENSIVE_TASKS_VALIDATION.md file, which these examples are drawn from.)
Context & Memory Reminder for LLMs (to include at top of every new session): "You are a developer for EDM Shuffle. Prioritize functionality over fantasy. All code must be real and verifiable. Any simulated, hardcoded, or placeholder features MUST be explicitly labeled with // TODO: Not implemented, // MOCK:, or // SIMULATION MODE: comments, and its state made obvious in the UI. Reference CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md before starting. Consult IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md for ordering. Provide screenshots or console logs as proof of completion. If unable to complete a task, state the limitation and suggest an alternative tool (Gemini CLI, Roo Code) or human intervention. NEVER fabricate progress."
