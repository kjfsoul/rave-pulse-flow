#### HOW TO USE THIS FILE
#### CURRENT OVERALL STATUS
Current Phase: Implementation of core features (User Auth, Audio Engine) with rigorous validation. Total Microtasks: See IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md. Integrity Status: High vigilance required. LLMs must adhere to CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md to prevent fabrication.
#### AGENT HAND-OFF NOTES
#### REALITY AUDIT / PLACEHOLDER DISCLOSURE
- DJMixStation.tsx - Crossfader - Claimed ✅ but found ⚠️: Visual only, no audible effect. Rolled back status to In Progress. // TODO: Implement real Web Audio API GainNode routing.
#### CHANGELOG (Recent History)
### Memory & Context Note for Next LLM:
### PHASE 1: User Authentication & Account System (Full User Journey)
1.1 User Registration & Login (Supabase)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no signup or login functionality on the live site. While a Supabase schema exists, it is not connected to any functional features.
1.2 OAuth Integration (Google/Discord)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. OAuth integration for social logins is currently not implemented.
1.3 Email: Password Reset (Forgot Password)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no password reset flow available.
1.4 Profile Management: Update Display Name, Email, Password
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There are no persistent user profiles where users can manage their details.
1.5 Account Deletion & Data Export
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. This feature has not been mentioned or implemented.
### PHASE 2: Audio Engine & Mix Station
2.1 Core Audio Engine (Web Audio API)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. Despite claims of "Real Audio Features" and "Web Audio API Integration", your direct observation confirms "no sound" and "no real music" on the site. The forensic audit found no actual <audio> elements or src attributes for playing MP3s. Audio context infrastructure exists but doesn't consistently start sound.
2.2 DJ Deck Controls (Play/Pause, Volume, Pitch, Crossfader, Echo FX)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Cosmetic). The UI for turntables and controls is present. However, your review notes that "scratch" and "echo" buttons only "animate visually but do nothing". The "Drop My Set" button triggers confetti but lacks true dual-track mixing. While Lovable claimed real crossfading, pitch shifting, and echo effects, the forensic audit indicates that turntables only "tweak a number" without real audio effects or drag functionality.
2.3 Waveform & BPM Visualization
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. While "Enhanced Equalizer" and "Real-time BPM Display" were claimed, the equalizer bar is not wired to BPM and is likely static. Your review confirmed a graphic "looks like bars that are playing something there is no sound".
2.4 Track Loading & Management (local files first, streaming caveats)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The app primarily uses hardcoded tracks or placeholder URLs. While "Real Track Loading" was claimed, the system for loading different audio files is not truly implemented, and the goal of integrating with streaming apps like Spotify is blocked by API constraints (no direct audio access).
2.5 Innovative Audio Enhancements (Dynamic EQ, Visual Feedback, Headphone Cueing, etc.)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Visual Feedback Only). Visual feedback on controls exists. Other enhancements like Dynamic EQ or Headphone Cueing are not yet implemented or detailed.
### PHASE 3: Voting & Festival Scheduling
3.1 Festival Voting Logic & Live Leaderboard
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Cosmetic/Spammable). The Festival Voting Stage visually displays DJ cards and vote counters, and the voting button "works" but has no limits or validation, allowing users to spam votes. The leaderboard is visual only and not based on real, live data. The headliner crowning is simulated.
3.2 Festival Schedule UI + Backend Data Model
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The current site lacks a comprehensive festival calendar; event data is static.
3.3 Event Creation/Joining & Headliner Logic
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no functionality for users to create or join events, and the headliner logic is purely simulated.
### PHASE 4: Challenges & Social
4.1 Dynamic Challenge Feed (Backend/API & Frontend Integration)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The ShuffleFeed page exists visually with elements like "trending shuffle clips" and "challenge tags", and video tiles show visual enhancements. However, there is no actual content feed, and actions like "Remix This" are "just buttons" without underlying logic. A forensic audit found no ShuffleFeed components in the provided files.
4.2 Challenge Submission Flow (File Upload, Caption, Squad Tagging)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. There is no actual mechanism for users to upload files, add captions, or tag squads for challenge submissions.
4.3 PLUR Leaderboard & Challenge Winners
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Visual Only). A "PLURstreak System" and a visual leaderboard are present. However, this is not based on real data or gamification logic.
### PHASE 5: Marketplace
5.1 Payments Integration (Stripe/Other)
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. Despite claims in documentation, the "Harsh Reality" assessment and your review explicitly state "no payment processing despite Stripe integration claims" and "no Stripe payment integration at all".
5.2 Product Listings & Inventory Management
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Static). "Gear Drops of the Day" carousel and product boxes are visually present with fake items. While user-submitted outfit galleries exist on the old site, the new project has no actual marketplace functionality.
5.3 Order Confirmation, Digital Downloads, Gift Flows
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. These post-purchase functionalities are not implemented.
### PHASE 6: Community & Crews
6.1 Live Chat System (Real-Time Messaging)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Fake). A "Festival Lounge" with a "fake chat feed" of pre-seeded messages is visually present.
6.2 Squad/Fam Features (Creation, Management, Invites)
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Placeholder/Visual). A "PLURcrew Builder Sidebar" with visual avatar cards and slots exists. The Archetype Quiz is meant to tie into this, but the crew system is a placeholder and not interactive. The "Avatar Summon System" is client-side only.
6.3 Commenting System
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Fake). Your review notes "just comments that are kind of feeding through probably presumably people Commenting".
### PHASE 7: Admin + Docs
7.1 Integrated Admin Dashboard
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. An admin dashboard is not implemented.
7.2 Documentation Pipeline: Root Directory + Microtask Enforcement
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Needs Update). Various documentation files exist (e.g., project_overview.md, technical_architecture.md). However, maintaining consistency and accuracy between claims and reality has been a recurring issue.
7.3 Integrity & Compliance Automation
Current Status: ⚠️ Partially Implemented (Conceptual). Integrity rules for LLMs (e.g., no placeholders without labels) have been defined, and tools like Gemini CLI are planned for validation. However, the automated enforcement of these principles is not yet fully in place.
7.4 Periodic Masterplan & FRS Review
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Functional Requirements Spec (FRS) are high-priority but were noted as "NOT YET WRITTEN".
### PHASE 8: Built-in Marketing Framework
8.1 Integrated Marketing Dashboard
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. A marketing dashboard is not implemented.
8.2 Content Generation & Library
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. While AI-generated content and autonomous content curation are part of the vision, the autonomous agents designed to deliver this are not deployed live and only produce fake output.
8.3 Marketing Best Practices, Failsafes, & Innovation
Current Status: ❌ Missing/Non-functional. While marketing strategies are outlined, the implementation of automation (n8n), approval workflows, and analytics integration within the platform itself is missing.
