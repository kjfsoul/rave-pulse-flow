# EDM Shuffle Masterplan

## Vision
Create a dynamic, community-driven EDM and shuffle dance platform that fuses festival spirit, music, and social creativity into an accessible digital rave—enabling any user to perform, remix, and headline with real DJ tools and authentic vibes.

## Strategic Objectives
- Prioritize real, working code over documentation or mockups
- Always prefer visible, testable features over architecture theater
- Lean on Gemini CLI for error-proof coding
- Use Claude Code for honest, step-by-step microtasking
- Archive all progress and lessons in versioned Markdown files
- Never exaggerate or fabricate progress—build trust with every commit

## Guiding Principles
- Build for community, not just code
- Mobile-first: every feature must work on phones
- MVP = what is working and visible, not what is planned or promised
- If anything breaks, log it, fix it, and document what was learned

## Milestones
- MVP: Real DJ Mix Station, Crowd FX, Subscription, Debug HUD, Honest System State
- Post-MVP: Marketplace, Social Voting, Live Streaming, Agent Integration (if ever)
