Live Nation also organizes three other major Belgian festivals: <strong>Rock Werchter, Dour, and Graspop</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation is being conducted independently and relies on rules that prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuses of dominant market positions under Belgian and European Union law.

His signature sound toes the line between underground sensibility and broad, radio-friendly appeal, characterized by high-energy tech house and booming, expertly crafted basslines.

He excels at taking simple melodic ideas and transforming them into euphoric, vocal-driven anthems that evoke a powerful sense of both nostalgia and uplift. His rare ability to seamlessly weave deep club cuts with massive, accessible tracks gives his festival sets a wide-ranging appeal, often creating personal and communal moments that define the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-odesza\">ODESZA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An <strong>ODESZA</strong> performance is more than just a DJ set but also a total sensory immersive experience. The duo masterfully blends downtempo textures, warm, expansive melodies, and moody percussion, taking the audience on a journey. They are masters of pacing, moving from intimate, vocal-driven segments to explosive, drum-powered climaxes with stunning precision. For their dedicated fans, ODESZA builds an entire world onstage, establishing their show as an emotional anchor of any festival weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-san-pacho\">San Pacho</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of modern tech house&#8217;s most dynamic acts, <strong>San Pacho</strong> brings an unwavering, magnetic momentum.

Rather than adhering to a single genre, his sets are a thrilling jump between funk, soul, disco, hip-hop, and house, driven purely by vibe. Expect wild, spontaneous transitions, live percussion flourishes, and the infectious charisma that has made him a beloved modern performer.

His signature sound toes the line between underground sensibility and broad, radio-friendly appeal, characterized by high-energy tech house and booming, expertly crafted basslines. Dom is one of dance music&#8217;s most consistently reliable draws, guaranteeing a set packed with irresistible energy and a communal atmosphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-duke-dumont\">Duke Dumont</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Duke Dumont</strong> offers a different, more nuanced shade of house music that&#8217;s lush, cinematic, and emotionally resonant. He excels at taking simple melodic ideas and transforming them into euphoric, vocal-driven anthems that evoke a powerful sense of both nostalgia and uplift. His rare ability to seamlessly weave deep club cuts with massive, accessible tracks gives his festival sets a wide-ranging appeal, often creating personal and communal moments that define the weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-odesza\">ODESZA</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An <strong>ODESZA</strong> performance is more than just a DJ set but also a total sensory immersive experience. The duo masterfully blends downtempo textures, warm, expansive melodies, and moody percussion, taking the audience on a journey. They are masters of pacing, moving from intimate, vocal-driven segments to explosive, drum-powered climaxes with stunning precision. For their dedicated fans, ODESZA builds an entire world onstage, establishing their show as an emotional anchor of any festival weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-san-pacho\">San Pacho</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of modern tech house&#8217;s most dynamic acts, <strong>San Pacho</strong> brings an unwavering, magnetic momentum.

It&#8217;ll be a set that surprises you with its creativity and then snowballs into a smile inducing, high octane sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dj-pee-wee-anderson-paak\">DJ Pee.Wee (Anderson .Paak)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Multi-talented artist <strong>Anderson .Paak</strong> steps behind the decks as <strong>DJ Pee .Wee</strong>, a persona that combines expert technical skill with pure, joyful chaos. Rather than adhering to a single genre, his sets are a thrilling jump between funk, soul, disco, hip-hop, and house, driven purely by vibe. Expect wild, spontaneous transitions, live percussion flourishes, and the infectious charisma that has made him a beloved modern performer.

Throughout the project, <strong>Father Funk</strong>’s roots as a guitarist, bassist, drummer and even trombonist within punk and ska bands seep into the digital fabric of his production. These tracks weave a wide spectrum of live instrumentation into their electronic pulse, intentionally sidestepping the typical build-drop formula in favor of grandiose, cinematic songwriting. The result is a cathartic, technicolor journey through <strong>Father Funk</strong>’s creative psyche, showcaseing an artist intent on shattering genre confines and industry expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans got their first tastes of&nbsp;<em><strong>Funk The System</strong></em>&nbsp;with two singles.

Then, in October, he released the punk-infused dubstep anthem, “<a href=\"https://found.ee/rageagain\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Rage Again</strong></a>” &#8211; a collaboration with rapper&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/def3/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Def3</strong></a>&nbsp;that nods to both artist’s punk rock roots, fusing gritty electric guitar and bass riffs with smooth vocals and surges of dubstep bombast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Funk The System\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/05YY0JmRms3XxKuWCOiDTE?referral=labelaffiliate&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=Indie_CDBaby&#038;utm_campaign=labelaffiliate\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another prime example of&nbsp;<strong>Father Funk</strong>’s uncompromising artistic vision can be found in the album’s rap-fueled focus track, “<strong>10 Toes Down</strong>.” Featuring&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kylegoldsteinmakesmusic/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Kyle Goldstein</strong></a>, “<strong>10 Toes Down</strong>” is a soulful dubstep bonanza, kicking off with cheeky brass melodies before transitioning into a propulsive trap beat mixed with euphoric trumpet, psychedelic guitar licks, and smooth flows from&nbsp;<strong>Goldstein</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Funk The System</strong></em>&nbsp;is filled to the brim with similarly infectious, genre-defying songs. The album opens with “<strong>The Beginning</strong>,” a cinematic introduction that builds from a moody guitar solo and rolling drums before erupting into a bold, attention-grabbing call to “<em>turn up the bass</em>.” “<strong>Jazzercise</strong>” follows suit, a playful, jazz-licked warm-up that teases its intentions before dropping into a high-impact, bass-driven workout anthem. The reggae-tinged “<strong>Nectar</strong>,” a collaboration with fellow Vancouver producer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/khutz_music/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>KHUTZ</strong></a>&nbsp;and vocalist/multi-instrumentalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prezencemusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Prezence</strong></a>, blends honey-smooth melodies and the mantra-like hook “<em>sipping on nectar of life</em>” over bass-hop beats dripping with low-end weight.&nbsp;<strong>Father Funk</strong>&nbsp;slows the pace with “<strong>Baby Talk</strong>,” a syrupy, talkbox-laced slow jam whose intimate swagger and retro sound palette stands apart from the album’s harder-edged rippers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album is then rounded out by the funk-fueled drum &amp; bass cut “<strong>2010 Was Alright</strong>,” the smoky, down-tempo, rap-led “<strong>Lights Out</strong>” featuring singer/songwriter&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.musicbyjozy.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Jozy</strong></a>&nbsp;and UK-based award-winning vocalist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thebigkathika/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Kathika</strong></a>, and the euphoric drum &amp; bass closer “<strong>Tonight</strong>,” driven by the irresistible refrain, “<em>everybody wants to get down tonight</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans can catch&nbsp;<strong>Father Funk</strong>&nbsp;playing tracks from his his 10-track LP alongside an arsenal of notorious bootleg bangers on his ongoing international ‘<strong>Funk The System Tour</strong>’ &#8211; a globe-trotting run that’ll see the producer perform in cities such as Denver (for his debut headlining show in the city), Seattle, Vancouver, and Bristol.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/father-funk-funk-the-system/\">Bass producer &amp; multi-instrumentalist Father Funk unveils new boundary-pushing album Funk The System</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Born from the legendary Belgian festival, <strong>Tomorrowland Brasil</strong> has firmly established itself as the premier electronic music gathering in South America. It transforms the lush landscape of Parque Maeda in Itu, São Paulo, into a surreal realm of unity and breathtaking artistry. The most recent chapter, the 2025 edition, was an emotional return under the theme <strong>&#8216;LIFE&#8217;</strong>. This event celebrated connection and nature with a stunning new Mainstage. It also featured a phenomenal lineup, including giants like David Guetta, Alesso, Armin van Buuren, and the local hero Alok. He broke records with a mesmerizing drone show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Tomorrowland finally dropped the highly anticipated Official Aftermovie for the 2025 event<a href=\"https://www.tomorrowland.com/article/tomorrowland-brasil-2025-aftermovie/\">,</a> fans around the world can relive the spectacle. The event included music, elaborate stage designs, and the unforgettable energy of the People of Tomorrow. Looking ahead, the festival has announced an intentional pause in 2026. This will ensure an even grander, more sustainable return in <strong>early 2027</strong>. It promises to bring back the magic stronger than ever to the heart of Brazil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the aftermovie, we can see takes of epic performances by artists like<strong> Agents Of Time, Alesso, Alok, ANNA b2b Vintage Culture, Argy, Armin van Buuren, Axwell, B Jones, Da Tweekaz, David Guetta, Henri PFR, John Newman, Kevin de Vries, Kölsch, NERVO, Nicky Romero, R3HAB, and Steve Aoki.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the visual heart of the Tomorrowland Brasil 2025 Aftermovie beats loudest when showcasing the phenomenal <strong>&#8216;LIFE&#8217; Mainstage</strong>. This incredible structure wasn&#8217;t just a backdrop; it was a character in itself. It became a staggering monument that turned into the largest and most intricate stage ever constructed in Latin America. In a deep commitment to the local culture and economy, the entire gargantuan structure was <strong>100% locally crafted</strong>. This is a testament to Brazilian artistry and engineering.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Tomorrowland Brasil 2025 aftermovie \" class=\"wp-image-392855\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251011-234547-TL25BR_AD-1068x712-1.jpg 1068w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-tomorrowland-brasil-aftermovie-2025-highlights\">Tomorrowland Brasil Aftermovie 2025 Highlights </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No aftermovie is complete without capturing the historic set delivered by the now festival icon <strong>Alok</strong>, a true ambassador of Tomorrowland Brasil. He elevated his performance not just by his pulsing signature sound but by a breathtaking, synchronized spectacle in the night sky. It shattered the Latin American record for drone usage in a live music show. <strong>Over 1,000 choreographed</strong> drones soared above the Mainstage, transforming the festival landscape into a dynamic, living canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The aftermovie captures the dazzling coordination as the lights shift and pivot. These lights form massive, iconic figures—from the floral symbol of the <strong>&#8216;LIFE&#8217;</strong> stage theme to a stunning rendition of the classic Tomorrowland logo. This monumental, multisensory moment, where light, sound, and technology merged perfectly, wasn&#8217;t just a part of the show. It was a powerful statement about the future of live electronic music. Additionally, it was a moment of pure Brazilian pride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that, the always unmistakable vibe of Brazilian people is evident. You see more than just people dancing; you see thousands moving as one—a kinetic sea of unity, chanting in unison, and bursting with visible joy. The camera work is masterful, using sweeping drone shots to capture the sheer size of the ecstatic masses. Following this, there are intimate, high-emotion close-ups of attendees in tears of happiness, embraced in friendship, and singing every lyric back to the DJs. This visceral passion, rooted deeply in Brazilian culture, creates an atmosphere where the music is felt, not just heard. It elevates the entire festival experience and leaves a lasting, unforgettable impression on the viewer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, this Aftermovie serves as the essential bridge. It lets you relive every moment of euphoria and unity. So, immerse yourself in the journey: watch the full Aftermovie, feel the beat of Brazil, and join the global community. Everyone is counting down the days until the grand return of Tomorrowland Brasil in <strong>early 2027</strong>.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>For this latest edition in the mix series, we sat down with the creative mind behind Rythmica, the label focused on deep, rhythm-led electronic music that has taken him from desert art gatherings to major festival stages. <span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/massiomusik/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Massio</a>&nbsp;sits at the intersection of detailed preparation and instinct, shaped by years of refining how he organizes music, tests new tracks, and reads a room in real time.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this mix, he leans into that approach with a selection that moves through Afro-house, melodic textures, and vocal-driven moments, all grounded in a clear sense of flow from start to finish. Below you can find the full tracklist, followed by a conversation about how he thinks about preparation, focus, and the point where technical skill and instinct start to feel like one process behind the decks.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2214361955&#038;color=%23ff5500&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true&#038;visual=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/magnetic-magazine\" title=\"Magnetic Magazine\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener\">Magnetic Magazine</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/magnetic-magazine/bd4c34cb-146e-4690-abdc-76007e00463c\" title=\"Magnetic Mix: Massio\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener\">Magnetic Mix: Massio</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What does flow feel like for you behind the decks?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Flow for me is a clear state of mind — being completely present and navigating my library with confidence. It’s knowing every detail of my most current selection — every break, drop, and transition point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That deep familiarity comes from practice. When you’ve tested and lived through your tracks, flow becomes effortless. I always pre-test new tunes in the studio, because some tracks hit differently live than they do in headphones. Once I’m comfortable, everything connects naturally — that’s when true flow happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you have any rituals, routines, or mental cues that help you get into that state?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely. Being well-rested and mentally grounded is essential. Knowing my music library inside and out gives me peace of mind before stepping on stage. On show days, one of my go-to rituals is spending time in nature during the morning — hiking, running, meditation are my go to rituals. It helps me recharge, reset, and carry a calm but powerful energy into the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How do you know when you’ve truly hit flow mid-set — and what helps you get there faster?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"708\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.18.43-AM-1024x708.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82406\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.18.43-AM-1024x708.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.18.43-AM-300x207.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.18.43-AM-768x531.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.18.43-AM.jpg 1403w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You feel it. Your brain and body start syncing with every beat, every reaction in the room. After an hour or so, it’s like your body expands — everything becomes instinctual. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I’ve hit flow when each transition feels timeless and the progression unfolds naturally, track after track. A well-organized playlist and preparation help me get there faster — that’s the foundation of every great journey behind the decks.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Has your ability to access flow changed over time? What’s helped?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability itself hasn’t changed — but the tools have. Over time, better organization systems and tech have helped me find the right track at the perfect moment. The more structured my library, the easier it is to trust my instincts. Experience also helps — with time, you learn to let go and just&nbsp;<em>feel</em>&nbsp;the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What tends to pull you out of flow — and how do you recover when that happens?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing an untested or unfamiliar track can throw things off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it works beautifully — other times it shifts the energy in a direction you didn’t plan. You can sense it immediately in the crowd’s reaction. The key is reading the room — adjusting, not forcing. A skilled DJ can always recover the vibe by understanding where the audience’s energy wants to go next.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Are there specific venues, crowds, or times of night that make flow feel more natural?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"624\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.19.26-AM-1024x624.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82408\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.19.26-AM-1024x624.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.19.26-AM-300x183.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.19.26-AM-768x468.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.19.26-AM-1536x936.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.19.26-AM.jpg 1539w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a mix of all three — the crowd, the venue, and the timing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A packed room at the right hour almost generates its own current of energy, making it easier to lock in. But small venues can be just as powerful — more intimate, more emotional. It’s all about adaptation. When all three elements align, flow becomes second nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When you&#8217;re in that state, does your mixing get more instinctual or more precise?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both. In flow, precision and instinct merge into one motion. Every EQ adjustment, every fade, every track choice becomes seamless. It’s almost like magic — the technical skill blends with intuition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s when the night transforms into a journey, and the crowd feels it too. In those moments, you’re not just performing — you’re channeling energy, shaping the atmosphere. That’s the real purpose of a DJ: to craft and sustain that collective vibe every single night.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/magnetic-mix-massio/\">Magnetic Mix: Massio</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

It combines his signature melodic bass sound with heavier, more introspective production, taking listeners from their darkest and uplifting them to better days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I starts quiet and dark with &#8216;<strong>Find Me In The Dark</strong>,&#8217; where baby blue&#8217;s soft voice floats over gentle piano before the beat finally kicks in. &#8216;<strong>Save Me</strong>&#8216; with Kate Morgan is the big, bright festival song everyone already knows, while &#8216;<strong>Monster</strong>&#8216; gets heavier and more intense with sharp, glitchy sounds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;<strong>Nightmare</strong>&#8216; with <strong>Fairlane</strong> and <strong>AMIDY</strong> is loud and chaotic in an exciting way, perfect for a mainstage. Things slow down for the dreamy &#8216;<strong>Waiting On This Day Forever</strong>,&#8217; then &#8216;<strong>Empty Space (Without You Pt. 2)</strong>&#8216; gives fans the bigger, more powerful follow-up they wanted to the older song. <strong>&#8216;Run</strong>&#8216; and &#8216;<strong>Too Good To Be True</strong>&#8216; tug on your heartstrings before bringing you back with soaring melodies. The album is touched up with &#8216;<strong>Goodbye</strong>&#8216; alongside <strong>Blanke</strong> and <strong>MGRD</strong>, a massive, bittersweet final song that mixes heavy beats with a sad-but-uplifting melody.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>German electronic music legend <strong>ATB</strong> has announced “The Final Chapter Tour 2026,” a landmark celebration marking nearly 30 years of timeless melodies, unforgettable performances, and global impact. The tour coincides with the release of his upcoming studio album, The Final Chapter, set for 2026 — an album that will close an extraordinary era in ATB’s career while opening the door to new creative horizons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 10 studio albums, over 55 gold and platinum awards worldwide, and an unbroken 23-year streak in the DJ Mag Top 100 DJs (currently ranked 59), ATB stands as one of electronic music’s most influential and beloved figures. His journey started with the 1998 breakout single “9pm (Till I Come),” which became the first dance track to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, paving the way for electronic music’s mainstream success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following that milestone, ATB delivered a steady stream of hits — including “Don’t Stop,” “Ecstasy,” “Let U Go,” “What About Us,” “Move On,” and “When It Ends It Starts Again.” Known for his emotional depth and signature blend of driving beats and ambient soundscapes, ATB’s work continues to resonate with fans across generations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While The Final Chapter marks ATB’s last studio album, it does not signal retirement. Instead, the artist views it as a celebration of his journey so far — and a bridge to what’s next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atb-music.com/tour/\">Tickets on sale now</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“This album closes a beautiful chapter, but it’s not the end of the story,”</em> says ATB. <em>“It’s a way to honor the music, the fans, and the memories that made it all possible.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new album’s lead single,<a href=\"https://umg.lnk.to/BelieveInLove\"> “Believe in Love” (feat. Shaun Farrugia)</a>, showcases ATB’s unmistakable melodic sensibility and emotional energy, reminding listeners why his sound has remained both timeless and forward-thinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fans will have the opportunity to relive three decades of musical milestones as ATB takes “The Final Chapter Tour” to some of his favorite U.S. cities. The exclusive run will feature timeless hits alongside never-before-heard material from the forthcoming album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From his groundbreaking debut to his latest productions, ATB has continually evolved — bridging the past and future of electronic music. His enduring influence can be heard in the work of today’s top DJs and producers, and his connection with fans remains as strong as ever. The Final Chapter Tour 2026 offers a chance to experience ATB’s legendary sound in an intimate live setting — a heartfelt tribute to the music, the memories, and the magic that have defined his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Believe In Love\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5jcqxzPZnGkMsNSxzFpJW5?go=1&#038;utm_campaign=fAfTD_96_fmly&#038;utm_source=oembed&#038;utm_medium=Original&#038;utm_content=ad3a162e-d699-42d5-a737-3c522b907eb7_none_ATB%2C+Shaun+Farrugia_100492901_Believe+In+Love_Believe+In+Love_20250828_direct_universal-music-germany_DE_umg.lnk.to%2Fbelieveinlove\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>ATB The Final Chapter Tour 2026 USA Tour Dates&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Feb 19 – TBA</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Feb 20 – Temple &#8211; Denver, CO&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Feb 21 – Academy &#8211; Los Angeles, CA</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Feb 27 – Q Nightclub &#8211; Seattle, WA</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Feb 28 – 45 East &#8211; Portland, OR</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>More dates to be announced</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/atb-announces-the-final-chapter-tour-2026/\"> ATB Announces “The Final Chapter Tour 2026”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

This year’s lineup is stacked with both international heavyweights and local favorites, delivering a fiery soundtrack for the frigid months ahead. The opening weekend brings house-heavy headliners <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/?s=disco+lines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disco Lines</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/SOFI-TUKKER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOFI TUKKER</a>, and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/The-Blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Blaze</a>, setting the tone for another unforgettable season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each following weekend ups the ante with performances from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/DJ-Snake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Snake</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Madeon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Madeon</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Elderbrook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elderbrook</a>, Skull Machine — an explosive new bass project from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Black-Tiger-Sex-Machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black Tiger Sex Machine</a> and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Kai-Wachi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kai Wachi</a> – <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Max-Styler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Styler</a>, and a rare back-to-back set from techno queens, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Nicole-Moudaber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicole Moudaber</a> and Montréal’s own <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Misstress-Barbara\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Misstress Barbara</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Igloofest wouldn’t be Igloofest without showcasing the city’s thriving local scene. Collectives like Ferias and Homegrown Harvest return for stage takeovers, bringing the underground energy that defines Montréal’s dance music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Montréal wraps, the Igloofest tour heads across the country — touching down in Gatineau (February 12–14), Québec City (March 6–8), and making its first-ever appearance in Edmonton from March 13–15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contact.igloofest.ca/presale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pre-sale registration</a> opens November 6 at 11 a.m. ET, with general on-sale to follow November 7 via Igloofest’s official website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: Alexis Monet</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpEmAzEcH_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>“<em>I have always believed that artist albums need a purpose</em>” says Johan Gielen, “<em>and that purpose can’t simply be feeding the industry machine or the bi-annual expectations of a fanbase</em>”. Nonetheless, it’s been nigh on twenty years since ‘Revelations’ appeared, making ‘<a href=\"https://blackhole.lnk.to/airscapeetherflow\">Etherflow</a>’ less of a ‘return’ to the Johan Gielen longplayer, and more a musical reckoning for it.<br><br>Fair to say then that expectations have been raised, and its taken the Belgium-born/Dutch-based legend three earth cycles of production to meet them. An album forged in grief, resilience, and a raw creative truth, ‘<a href=\"https://blackhole.lnk.to/airscapeetherflow\">Etherflow</a>’ isn’t just a long-awaited ‘next chapter’. It’s part an epic celebration of life, and part an existential excavation of it &#8211; one that’s been written from the inside out and charged by the weight of lived experience.<br><br>As Johan himself puts it: “<em>there’s the Beauty of Silence, but also ‘the beauty of absence”</em>. ‘<a href=\"https://blackhole.lnk.to/airscapeetherflow\">Etherflow</a>’ though is where that absence ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392861\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-696x696.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-1068x1068.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow-420x420.jpg 420w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Johan-Gielen-presents-Airscape-Etherflow.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s in a title then? Johan expands … “<em>Etherflow</em> <em>represents the natural, continuous movement of universal energy — an invisible current that connects every being, thought, and element of existence in a harmonious manner</em>.” Which is important, as that perspective on life is bound into every musical bar of the album &#8211; one that’s shaped by events all too real in Gielen’s life.<br><br>Specifically, it carries the weight of loss, most notably in the passing of his long-time friend and tour manager, Robert Sanders. Paradoxically, that became the most significant driving force in Johan’s return to the album form, which ultimately brought his second longform to life.<br><br>“<em>Losing Robert broke me for a long while” </em>says Johan.<em> “For a decade we toured the world and saw it together, and his passing came out of nowhere. With hindsight, I see I went into the studio to try to process some of that pain. To try to ‘write it off my chest’ in some fashion. From there, the album became a broader meditation of life’s ups and downs — the highs, the lows, but as well, the ‘in-betweens’ we’re often not grateful enough for. It’s about growing up in dance music and oddly the twenty years of perspective between ‘Revelations’ and ’Etherflow’ was an incredible benefit to writing it. Ultimately though, this one’s for Robert — it’s how I expressed my grief, without words.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that respect, the track ‘Beach Pearl (Robert’s Theme)’ does stand as a major emotional centre within ‘Etherflow — an instrumental tribute formed in the quiet after heartbreak. However, ‘Etherflow’ as a whole is no longform eulogy. Be it the sun-drenched optimism of ‘Piano del Sol’, ‘Love from Above’s divination; recent (speaks-for-itself) single title ‘Ecstatica’ (with Daniel Wanrooy)&nbsp;or Pierre Pienaar co-op ‘Marula Sunset’, it radiates positivity at any number of junctures.<br><br>What <em>does</em> run the length of ‘<em>Etherflow’</em> though is the spark of a chance writer’s camp meeting between Johan and Arkayne (Kevin van der Tholen) — a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist who wasn’t even meant to be there that day. Over the last three years, Arkayne became an essential creative partner on the album. Their bond brought new textures and instrumentation to it — from live guitars to sweeping piano lines. “<em>Kevin says I’m like a walking music encyclopaedia,” Johan laughs, “but he’s the real musician. Piano, guitar, vocals — he does it all, and you can hear so much of that threaded into the album.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In its latter stages, ‘Etherflow looks upwards again, albeit not to the heavens, but the skies. Says Johan, I did two tracks side by side with Joakim ‘Shakespeakers’ Skeide. <em>“A couple of years ago he booked me for a gig in Norway, where he also has a studio. We hadn’t planned on working together, but when he mentioned it, I said, ‘hey, let’s try something’ and’ ten minutes later we had a track started. Norway is one of my favourite places, and after fishing and hiking with Joakim, those experiences naturally flowed into the music. ‘Nordic Chant’ and ‘</em><em>Satellites</em>’<em> capture that Norway vibe — the Northern Lights, the mountains, the skies and the raw beauty of the country – it’s all bound up in them.”<br><br></em>Johan’s ‘<a href=\"https://blackhole.lnk.to/airscapeetherflow\">Etherflow</a>’ doesn’t so much close an album circuit, as it opens up a current. One that runs through memory, healing, and the unbroken rhythm of creation itself.

After signing a new agreement in 2023, Prydz&#8217; complaint says St. John commenced paying himself for unapproved work without notifying the artist or his team. Consequently, Prydz&#8217;s manager had their working contract with St. John terminated. St John, with whom Prydz has worked since 2012, committed <strong>&#8220;in writing&#8221; </strong>to complete a final tax return for Prydz.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"827\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"392870\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-827x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392870\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-827x1024.jpeg 827w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-242x300.jpeg 242w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-768x951.jpeg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-324x400.jpeg 324w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-696x862.jpeg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2-339x420.jpeg 339w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-2.jpeg 1017w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 827px) 100vw, 827px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"822\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"392871\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1-822x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392871\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1-822x1024.jpeg 822w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1-241x300.jpeg 241w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1-768x956.jpeg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1-696x867.jpeg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1-337x420.jpeg 337w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-17-at-19.18.20-1-1.jpeg 1011w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 822px) 100vw, 822px\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/files/2025/11/Eric-Prydz-v-Thomas-St-John-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">the complaint</a>,&nbsp;St. John demanded payment of <strong>$150,000</strong> for<strong> “unapproved, out of scope” </strong>services before filing the return.&nbsp;Described as &#8216;extortion&#8217; in the complaint, Prydz never made the payment leading to the return being never filed. “As a direct result of [St. John’s] malicious conduct to hold Prydz’s financial documents hostage, Prydz has been unable to complete and file the now past due tax forms,” complaint states.

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation. His &#8220;One Sound, Two Sides&#8221; philosophy translates into production that feels equally at home during peak-time festival moments and those rare club instances when everyone actually connects with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What separates this from typical progressive fare is TR3AL&#8217;s stated ambition beyond the booth. He&#8217;s developing a fully immersive live show incorporating visuals and motion-capture characters, treating each release as a narrative chapter rather than isolated singles. That cinematic storytelling approach is already evident in &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; &#8211; the track builds with genuine dramatic arc rather than just hitting familiar progressive house checkpoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a debut album and live show planned for 2026, TR3AL&#8217;s positioning himself as more than another festival circuit DJ. &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; captures what he describes as &#8220;the rush of energy you feel when you&#8217;re fully present&#8221; &#8211; ambitious conceptual framework aside, the track simply works as both emotional statement and dancefloor weapon.

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

At each corner there are various food joints, amenities such as the Beauty Bar, and plenty of space to roam around. On the outer edges Headliners could find all the EDC essentials: info booths, merch tents, free water refills, and more! Light-up tunnels guide you into the colorful center of EDC and make for a great meeting spot with friends.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for a Wonderful EDC Las Vegas 2021!</h2>\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic was, and still is in many ways, a difficult time for everyone, but we are infinitely grateful to have been able to reunite with our Headliners this year Under The Electric Sky.

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>Jay Pryor has released “Funk 2 Da,” his newest track and his first on Gorgon City’s Realm Records. Born in Dublin and now based in Los Angeles, Pryor has worked across both dance and pop music, and this release highlights the direction he has been leaning toward in his recent solo work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Funk 2 Da” uses a steady bassline and short <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tag/vocal-house/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"7336\">vocal </a>elements to create a clean, rhythmic pattern. The track is built for movement, keeping the structure tight and direct from start to finish. It first began circulating when Dom Dolla played it in his sets, which eventually led to <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/starkillers-announces-launch-brand-new-record-label-brawla-records/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"31889\">Realm </a>reaching out to sign the record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pryor’s background includes production and writing across a wide range of artists, including Louis Tomlinson, <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tag/steve-aoki/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"1003\">Steve Aoki</a>, ZAYN, Diplo, Niall Horan, Anne-Marie, and Alok. His earlier breakout came from co-producing “Just Hold On,” which went on to surpass 600 million streams and earn multiple platinum certifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his own catalog, Pryor has shifted from melodic crossover material to more house-driven records such as “Say Something,” “Good For Me,” and “Space Jam.” His work has earned support from Dom Dolla, John Summit, Tiësto, Chris Lake, Skream, Gorgon City, Cloonee, and Diplo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With “Funk 2 Da,” Pryor continues to build a sound that blends his polished production background with club-focused rhythms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outro:</strong><br>The single is available now on Realm Records, with more releases expected as Pryor continues to expand his presence in modern house music.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Funk 2 Da\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3MkJiPfIi5sUN24WATi1kg?si=755412cb6e5347ff&utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure><p>The post <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/jay-pryor-funk-2-da/\">Jay Pryor Shares New Single “Funk 2 Da” Through Realm Records</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com\">Daily Beat</a>.</p>",

He is the Berlin-based former Bar25 resident who heads up Ouïe Records with Acid Pauli and draws on downtempo, jazz, and hip-hop in his richly layered grooves. Tooker, meanwhile, is a former member of the acclaimed DJ duo KMLN and a multi-instrumentalist who often incorporates live percussion into his performances at events such as ADE, BPM Festival, Burning Man, and Woomoon Ibiza.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This latest track from the pair has a long and special history. Tooker first began the idea many years ago during a period of deep inspiration and creative flow in Bali. When the first version came together, he already felt it was the kind of piece that would one day be beautiful to develop with Nico Stojan, even though they had not yet met at that moment. A few years later, the connection finally happened in Berlin when, in one night, the whole track came alive, shaped by their shared taste, musicality, and eﬀortless chemistry. Since then, it became one of their signature pieces and has been played in every set for the last several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;Perla&#8217; is a sophisticated exploration of melody, featuring subtle synths and icy bells, soft chord sequences, and golden bells that weave in and out of a supple groove. It&#8217;s quietly intense and rich in detail, so it pulls your attention in many diﬀerent directions at once, all while you get carried away by the deep, escapist groove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Tooker &amp; Nico Stojan&#8217;s &#8216;Perla&#8217; comes on Sonara Records on 10th December 2025.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Tracklist</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">1.

Drawing on his extensive experience as a producer, sound engineer, and live performer at festivals such as Burning Man and Coachella, he infuses the track with driving rhythms and cinematic layers &#8211; bridging the gap between emotive storytelling and floor-filling energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>London-based&nbsp;<strong>Leena Punks</strong>&nbsp;turns her attention to ‘Broken Glass’, offering a vibrant, melodic house-infused interpretation. Since emerging in 2020, Leena has rapidly built a global following with her dynamic approach, earning support from artists such as Armin Van Buuren, Korolova, and Gorgon City. Her remix balances driving lead synths with intricate subtleties, reimagining the original track while preserving its emotional core, making it equally suited for peak-time festival sets and late-night club rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release marks another chapter in Booka Shade’s ongoing ‘For Real’ remix series, highlighting both established and rising talent within the global electronic music community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Booka Shade ‘Glare/Broken Glass’ (Sainte Vie &amp; Leena Punks Remixes) drops via Blaufield Music on 21</strong><strong>st</strong><strong>&nbsp;November 2025.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>PRE ORDER &#8216;GLARE/BROKEN GLASS (SAINTE VIE &amp; LEENA PUNKS REMIXES)&#8217; <a href=\"https://bfan.link/glare-broken-glass-remixes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HERE</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Tracklist:</strong><br />1.

Put your trust in the wrong person and you could&nbsp;<em>swipe right</em>&nbsp;into a load of heartache. We’ve all been there, and so has award-winning Toronto singer-songwriter Henry Lees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">“Smoke” <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kmMR0wpBj0U\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a> and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1a5T3reCByrrdwkNdW1Rjq?si=41316143995f485e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Smoke by Henry Lees - Visualizer\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kmMR0wpBj0U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lees knows the perils of romantic pursuit all too well and some of those experiences provided the kindling for his fired up, funky new single, “Smoke”, available everywhere November 14, 2025 and adding some spice to the start of another super sweet, Hallmark-drenched holiday season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like to call ‘Smoke’ the bad dream date song,” offers Lees. “The reality is that it’s tough out there in the modern digital dating world, Connections are made so conveniently on a screen but, you can often discover how tenuous and superficial that connection is in real life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s a good thing though that bitter disappointment can be great fuel for a song,”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You made promises you knew you’d never keep</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You lit the fire then, left me smouldering in the street</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Now, I want all the charming words you spoke to disappear like smoke</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-written with and produced by Vancouver-based singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer-on-the-rise Sean Thomas (Debbie Gibson, Joey McIntyre, NKOTB, New Edition), “Smoke” was ignited and almost completely finished during a single, laugh out loud cross-country writing session between Lees and Thomas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There’s always an incredible energy co-writing with Henry,” notes Thomas. “He has such a natural talent for translating his passions into powerful, heartfelt songwriting. It was an honour to produce this track and bring it to life!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new collaboration already garnered pre-release industry honours when Lees was chosen as a Semi-Finalist in the Best AC Artist category for the 2025 Unsigned Only Music Awards based on the strength of “Smoke” as a submission to the annual, international contest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was a real gift to have “Smoke” rise up and almost magically appear for Sean and me,” notes Lees. “Then, recognition by a major international music competition confirmed our feeling that we created something very special with this song.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the first time Lees and Thomas have won accolades for their collaborations. “Free This Love”, a 2023 single by Lees, co-written with Heather Pirie and Matt Gerber and produced by Thomas, became a Top 10 Finalist in the Pop category for the 27th USA Songwriting Awards and a Semi-Finalist for both the 2023 International Songwriting Competition and Unsigned Only. An earlier Lees/Thomas song, “Nothing Left to Lose” won second place honours in the 2021 Indie International Song Contest and was named a Top 10 Finalist for the 17th annual International Acoustic Music Awards. Since 2021, Lees’ songs have been honoured 10 times by major music competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Sean and I met and started writing together during the annual SongStudio Workshop in Toronto in 2018,” notes Lees. “I’m thrilled to see his career bloom as a sought after writer, musician and producer doing amazing work with legendary pop icons like Debbie Gibson and Joey McIntyre and still finding time to produce and release his own brilliant music. I’m grateful for what we get to create together.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to this, Lees’ varied musical life included writing, recording and performing everything from radio jingles to musical theatre and has taken him from the national airwaves to stages across Canada, including singing on two cross-Canada Huron Carole benefit tours with singer-songwriter, actor, philanthropist and Officer of the Order of Canada Tom Jackson. Shannon Gaye, a dear friend Lees’ sang with on those Huron Carole tours and an accomplished Canadian singer-songwriter with a number of releases to her credit, provides the soulful harmony vocals on “Smoke”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Lees celebrated his first number ones as a songwriter when triple Maple Blues Award nominee Chris Antonik and his album “Morningstar” hit #1 for 2 weeks on Roots Music Report’s all-genre, Top 50 Canada Albums Chart and “Back to the Good”, one of six songs Lees’ co-wrote with Antonik for the album, also hit #1 on the RMR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in 2022, Lees released the single “Walking With Fear”, a very personal song of support for those dealing with anxiety disorders co-written with multi-award winning singer-songwriter David Leask and produced by Leask with JUNO winner Steve Dawson and The Henhouse Express. “Walking With Fear” was released in partnership with Anxiety Canada in support of Action Anxiety Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And more music is on the way from Lees, with three more singles and a full EP in the works for 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, has creating “Smoke” cleared away at least some of Henry Lees’ own bad-dream-date memories?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m very happily past those dangerous dating pool days,” he says, “but long may those life experiences keep the songwriting fires burning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://henryleesmusic.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website</a> I <a href=\"https://henrylees.bandcamp.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bandcamp</a> I <a href=\"https://facebook.com/henryleesmusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a> I <a href=\"https://instagram.com/henryleesmusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a> I <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@henryleesmusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/henry-lees-fires-off-a-funky-kiss-off-with-blazing-new-single-smoke/\">Henry Lees Fires Off a Funky Kiss Off with Blazing New Single &#8220;Smoke&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Psytrance artists like Blastoyz, Ghost Rider, and Blazy feature heavily on the lineups announced for Halfmoon Festival&#8217;s December 2025 &#8211; February 2026 outings. </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Halfmoon Festival</strong> — which takes place twice a month in <strong>Koh Phangan</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> — has just announced the headliners slated to play its <strong>December 2025 &#8211; February 2026</strong> gatherings. And spoiler alert if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with this event brand: these lineups go heavy on the psytrance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Blastoyz</strong> is an obvious standout of the upcoming Halfmoon Festival lineups. Having produced music since he was only nine years old, the Israeli artist counts collaborations with the likes of Seven Lions, Vini Vici, and Infected Mushroom among his career accomplishments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hailing from Brazil, <strong>Blazy</strong> has also generated his fair share of buzz. In 2017, he became the youngest artist to top the Beatport psytrance chart, a feat he&#8217;s now accomplished eight separate times. In 2024, he released his debut album, <em>The Chase</em>, to resounding praise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ghost Rider</strong> represents Russia on the Halfmoon Festival winter lineups, and for good reason. Ever since he released his first album on psytrance mainstay Iboga Records in 2012, he&#8217;s landed on lineups at festivals like A State Of Trance, Universo Paralello, and XXXPERIENCE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>German DJ and producer <strong>NEELIX</strong> isn&#8217;t strictly a psytrance artist, but he&#8217;ll appeal to those in attendance all the same. He&#8217;s been active since the turn of the millennium, famous for his unique fusion of progressive trance, progressive house, and electro. His distinct sound will perfectly complement that of the other artists on the lineups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other artists on the Halfmoon Festival winter lineups include <strong>Reality Test</strong>, <strong>Querox Berg</strong>, <strong>WHITENO1SE</strong>, <strong>Silver Panda</strong>, <strong>Blanka</strong>, <strong>Ranji</strong>, <strong>MR.BLACK</strong> <strong>Tezla</strong>, <strong>IARA</strong>, <strong>Don&#8217;t Blink</strong>, <strong>Tali Muss</strong>, <strong>Javier Gonzalez</strong>, and <strong>Dirty Andy</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Halfmoon Festival has been active in Koh Phangan since 2002, offering a more specialized alternative to the Full Moon Party popular among youths. With a few exceptions, each edition typically takes place either one week before or after the Full Moon Party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full lineups and ticket information for each of the upcoming editions of Halfmoon Festival can be found on the <a href=\"https://www.halfmoonfestival.com/2025-dates\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.halfmoonfestival.com/2025-dates\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">event website</a>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow Halfmoon Festival:</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.halfmoonfestival.com/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.halfmoonfestival.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/halfmoonfestival\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.facebook.com/halfmoonfestival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/halfmoonfest\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://twitter.com/halfmoonfest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">X</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/halfmoon.festival\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.instagram.com/halfmoon.festival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4PswnhqOgZqGzmZxxVK00g\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4PswnhqOgZqGzmZxxVK00g\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com/2025/11/17/halfmoon-festival-winter-2025-2026-lineups/\">Halfmoon Festival Winter Program Puts Psy on Center Stage in Thailand</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com\">EDM Identity</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p><strong>Dreamstate Records</strong> celebrates ten years as a leader in international trance music with <strong>&#8217;10 Years of Dreamstate,&#8217;</strong> an epic 20-track collection bringing together the genre&#8217;s founding figures, contemporary legends, and emerging talent. Releasing on November 14th, the project commemorates a decade of musical elevation, documenting the progression of one of the planet&#8217;s premier trance platforms in advance of the <strong><a href=\"https://dreamstate.frontgatetickets.com/?utm_source=Promoters&amp;utm_medium=edmlife&amp;utm_campaign=edmlife\">Dreamstate SoCal festival</a></strong> in Long Beach.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dreamstate.ffm.to/10yearsofdreamstate\">Fans can click here to stream the album.</a></p>\n<p>From its launch, <strong>Dreamstate</strong> has supported every branch and substyle of trance—spanning uplifting and progressive to hard and techno-influenced variations—nurturing a worldwide community dedicated to the genre&#8217;s heartfelt and ecstatic essence. The collection pays tribute to that heritage, showcasing performers who have influenced Dreamstate&#8217;s festivals, concerts, and nightclub gatherings around the world.</p>\n<p>Leading the collection is the official <strong>2025 Dreamstate SoCal</strong> festival anthem, <strong>&#8220;Is This Only a Dream?&#8221; by Paul van Dyk and Aly &amp; Fila</strong>, which captures the enduring power and collective spirit that characterize the Dreamstate experience. The track pulses with the dramatic craftsmanship of these two influential figures—rippling melodic sequences, celestial soundscapes, and dreamlike vocal narration that evokes the wonder and tranquility of dawn breaking over festival attendees. Acting as both focal point and declaration, it reinforces the persistent essence that has sustained Dreamstate throughout its inaugural decade.</p>\n<p>Building on this radiant opening, &#8217;10 Years of Dreamstate&#8217; presents an expansive exploration of trance&#8217;s diverse terrain. <strong>Nifra</strong> and <strong>Sarah de Warren</strong> collaborate again on &#8220;On Repeat,&#8221; fusing vocal trance sentiment with techno&#8217;s raw edge. Warren&#8217;s captivating vocal delivery weaves through rhythmic triplet patterns and rave-inspired stabs before erupting into an intense, hard-hitting peak. Having previously worked together on &#8220;Time,&#8221; their partnership solidifies around a production designed for both contemplation and main-stage impact.</p>\n<p>Operating as <strong>Stoneblue</strong>, <strong>Ilan Bluestone</strong> presents &#8220;The Land of Nanisa,&#8221; an epic narrative grounded in intimate meaning and melodic brilliance. Created for his fiancée—and notably featured during his on-stage engagement at Dreamstate San Francisco—the composition builds with orchestral arrangements, choral vocals, and propulsive 138-BPM energy, capturing the profound emotion central to Bluestone&#8217;s artistic expression.</p>\n<p>Norwegian powerhouse <strong>Ørjan Nilsen</strong> and Dutch phenom <strong>Mark Sixma</strong> are established dance music figures requiring no introduction. Beyond their individual prominence on Dreamstate bills through solo work, their joint venture nilsix has been making waves since debuting on the label in 2023. Claiming two positions on the compilation, their track &#8220;Blast From The Past&#8221; delivers substantial main-stage power within its melodic techno structure. They return with the distinctive Intro Mix—gradually building to maximum impact—a suspense-laden version demonstrating masterful audience engagement by two industry veterans.</p>\n<p><strong>Taylor Torrence</strong> explores more shadowy, industrial-influenced realms with &#8220;Collide,&#8221; a fierce, acid-driven piece constructed from explosive synth layers, interstellar pads, and authoritative spoken-word elements. The Los Angeles-based producer continues merging trance and techno force, following his latest single &#8220;Voodoo&#8221; and a North American run including <strong>Dreamstate SoCal, EDC Thailand</strong>, and multiple club appearances throughout the country.</p>\n<p>The underground energy persists through <strong>Mark Sherry</strong> and frequent label contributor <strong>David Forbes</strong>, whose exclusive offering, &#8220;This Is the Phuture,&#8221; exemplifies their characteristic rapid-fire tech-trance—precise stabbing synths, powerful low frequencies, and constant momentum. Simultaneously, <strong>Matty Ralph, Laura van Dam, and Q.U.A.K.E</strong> contribute festival-ready sentiment and melodic elevation, highlighting trance&#8217;s continuous progression toward a contemporary, blended aesthetic.</p>\n<p>Among the remixes, <strong>David Forbes</strong> returns to accelerate <strong>Key4050&#8217;s &#8220;Cisza&#8221;</strong>—the 2022 Dreamstate Europe anthem—into high gear, intensifying its anthemic energy with acid-infused bass and rapid-fire percussion. <strong>Darren Porter</strong> transforms <strong>Giuseppe Ottaviani&#8217;s</strong> &#8220;Keep Your Dreams Alive&#8221; with expansive orchestral arrangements and melodic expression, injecting dramatic depth into the 2019 Dreamstate Europe anthem while reinforcing trance&#8217;s lasting sense of optimism and magnificence.</p>\n<p>Additionally,<strong> Paul Oakenfold, Trance Wax, Lost Minds, Factor B, and Jordan Suckley</strong> each contribute unique elements to the compilation&#8217;s spectrum—from uplifting harmonic sequences to contemplative atmospheres and prime-time momentum. Emerging artist <strong>Fish56Octagon</strong> concludes the experience with &#8220;Let U Know,&#8221; representing the progressive outlook influencing trance&#8217;s upcoming era.</p>\n<p>Throughout its 20 selections, &#8217;10 Years of Dreamstate&#8217; functions as both historical reflection and fresh discovery—a homage to the producers, supporters, and instances that have characterized the phenomenon. From established legends to genre-expanding artists, the compilation reflects Dreamstate&#8217;s international reach: a comprehensive presentation of trance that surpasses periods, styles, and assumptions.</p>\n<p>A decade later, Dreamstate continues serving as a guiding light for devotees globally—advancing while respecting the sonic identity that established its reputation. &#8217;10 Years of Dreamstate&#8217; embodies that balance completely: tradition and progression, remembrance and future direction, merging in one significant release.</p>\n<p><strong>‘10 Years of Dreamstate&#8217; Track List:</strong></p>\n<p>01.Paul van Dyk and Aly &amp; Fila – Is This Only a Dream?

After his collaboration with Cloonee ‘Stephanie’ soared to #1 on Beatport in just three days, he now returns to&nbsp;<strong>Hellbent Records</strong>&nbsp;with his first solo outing, riding the wave of his breakout success and staking his claim as a rising force in the global scene. Backed by further heavyweights, including Chris Lake, Fisher, Dom Dolla, and Wade, his productions are defined by a bold, dynamic energy, most recently showcased via his collaboration with Florida rapper Lil Pump. Closing out 2025 with authority, his first solo statement on Hellbent arrives fully formed, showcasing a producer who knows how to move bodies and crowds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Night Hustle’ captures InntRaw’s growing trademark sound: a combination of hypnotic grooves, intricate percussive layers, and a powerful low-end drive that builds steadily into a peak-time eruption. Every element of the track is carefully crafted to create momentum, echoing the energy he brings to his DJ sets and reflecting the level of support he has already earned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this drop, InntRaw isn’t just following up on previous success; he’s demonstrating that his rise is just beginning, positioning himself as one of Brazil’s most exciting emerging talents and a name to watch on dancefloors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>InntRaw</strong>&nbsp;<strong>‘Night Hustle’ EP drops via Hellbent Records on 21</strong><strong>st</strong><strong>&nbsp;November 2025.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Tracklist:</strong><br />1) Night Hustle</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>InntRaw</strong><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/inntraw/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/inntrawhttps://soundcloud.com/inntraw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/0j6Tcp4NiZqsS3OEl4ppLw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Hellbent Records</strong><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hellbentrecs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hellbentrecords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Hellbentrecs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hellbentrecs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Twitter (X)</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/brazils-inntraw-makes-his-solo-hellbent-records-debut-with-night-hustle/\">Brazil&#8217;s InntRaw makes his solo Hellbent Records debut with &#8216;Night Hustle&#8217;.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

The four-track package leans into tightly wound percussion, industrial tension, and functional techno built for late hours. Already supported by Chris Liebing, Francois X, and Chlär, the EP adds weight to a catalog that has stretched across Planet Rhythm, CLR, and decades of residencies throughout Portugal and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7duYDJKofDBersYqvS6ZZI?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this release relevant is not only the music but the mindset behind it. In this interview, Dextro speaks candidly about how DJ culture has shifted since the early nineties — from carrying crates and earning respect in empty rooms to a world where visibility, agency backing, and fast attention can replace slow growth. He reflects on lost rituals, fading values, and the pressure to treat DJing as a business rather than a craft. For him, longevity has always come from consistency, principles, and a direct connection with the dancefloor, not from shortcuts or image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Ground Level</em> fits that philosophy. It is built for function, endurance, and physical response. No gimmicks, no trend-chasing, no quick-hit hooks. Just straight momentum from someone still committed to opening a room, raising the tempo with intention, and trusting that the music is enough. Below is the full conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve been in this game a long time — what’s one change in DJ culture that still surprises you when you think about it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello and thanks again for this interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, DJ culture practically ceased to exist when the pandemic came, where much has changed and for the worse. I believe I do not need to say more about it; it is explicit these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What feels totally different about the way new DJs come up now compared to when you were starting out?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This question is pertinent, not wanting to make comparisons, but has nothing to do with 8 to 80. The difference of wanting to be Dj and fighting for it, and doing things, so today in months, if you have an agency and some marketing, you are playing everywhere with everyone, and in 2 years, you&#8217;re practically a newborn pseudo &#8220;star.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are there any rituals, values, or small things from the early days that you think have totally disappeared?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"704\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.27.24-AM-1024x704.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-81987\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.27.24-AM-1024x704.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.27.24-AM-300x206.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.27.24-AM-768x528.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.27.24-AM.jpg 1493w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahahah so good this question, effectively ceased to be the same, I know that times have advanced and we have to follow them, or play the same game, because some play to be in the limelight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But deep down they hate to do this. Still, the money speaks louder for many, but not for me; I play my game as I have since 91. There is no respect for anything anymore. They all do what they wanna do, no limits to reach the goals. Of course, there are many DJs who respect others and have the old school values. Still, in general not really, practically all vanished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On the flip side — what’s something about DJing or the scene that’s stayed surprisingly the same?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I start by saying that the scene does not remain the same from afar, because it was challenging to be a DJ in the past; it was difficult to buy the track you heard at a party, the records arrived late, and only some had access to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it was always something that was not available to everyone at the time without so much technology you needed to know how to play music, work to achieve, to achieve today it&#8217;s all against the little music matters and the marketing and image and promoters are above the music of the artists, they choose who they want to be Dj, look at the difference of the old for the current, of course many good new artists did not do this and have much value, that is very explicit and I respect that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Has your relationship to the crowd changed over the years — or do you still approach that connection the same way?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been a resident for 15 years, I like to open the dance floor and go doing up the bpm and the groove, lasting 4 to 6 hours was normal at the time, so my behavior remains the same and with the same passion as if I had to play for 10 or 1000 people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you think the role of the DJ has changed in a deeper way — not just the tools, but the purpose?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"730\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.30.00-AM-1024x730.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-81988\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.30.00-AM-1024x730.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.30.00-AM-300x214.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.30.00-AM-768x547.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-04-at-11.30.00-AM.jpg 1075w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I do not know which of the new artists I can speak for, because I have been doing this with passion since I was 15 years old. I have never changed my ideas and principles now I know that most have no respect and principles because they want is to get as fast as possible up there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To contribute to this, many promoters and agencies are to blame because it has become more of a business than a passion, as it is clear that everyone has to be paid for what they do, but fairly and impartially, not in a mercenary way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could sit down with your younger self behind the decks, what would you say — if anything?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I would say is good that you do what you do and never lose sight of wanting to be Dj and make music, and maintain the same posture to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/dj-dextro-on-his-mood-debut-and-why-respect-still-has-to-be-earned/\">DJ Dextro on His MOOD Debut and Why Respect Still Has to Be Earned</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>SubDocta’s <em>Almost Cool</em> EP arrives on BTSM’s label as a compact set of tracks built on precise production choices and clear rhythmic structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Compliments” sets the tone with a relaxed house pattern built around steady drums and a nostalgic filter. “Delulu,” his collaboration with Mport, introduces a wobblier bass design and off-center accents that shift the feel of the EP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Bodies” shifts into drum &amp; bass, using clipped drums and narrow synths to keep space in the arrangement. The final two songs — “Poison Ivy” and “Girls” — revisit familiar palettes but with adjusted pacing. The tracklist functions like a brief walkthrough of SubDocta’s core sounds without repeating older formulas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A theme of restraint runs throughout the project. He keeps enough room in each track for the groove to stay clean, even when the production leans heavier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With <em>Almost Cool</em>, SubDocta continues shaping a sound suited for clubs, festivals, and smaller rooms, with more releases planned for the year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Almost Cool\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7icyoMWivD0Wb21EDI5Wji?si=ddeaa2210d44495c&utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure><p>The post <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/subdocta-almost-cool-ep/\">SubDocta Focuses on Epic Production and a Clean Style on 'Almost Cool' EP</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com\">Daily Beat</a>.</p>",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Toolroom’s latest release arrives with a certain weight. The Creator brings together Low Steppa, Rue Jay and REZA around one of the most recognisable voices in house culture, the spoken presence of Chuck Roberts. It is a vocal that tends to reshape a room the moment it appears, and the trio build around it with a clear sense of purpose, keeping the spirit of the original message intact while pushing into a more contemporary space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rue Jay and REZA come at the collaboration from different paths but share a similar grounding. Rue has built a reputation across UK clubs for high energy sets that lean into classic house textures without feeling retro. REZA has been a mainstay producer and DJ for more than two decades, releasing on labels like Defected, Stealth and Toolroom, and shaping a sound that bridges old and new with a studio approach that stays focused on clarity. The Creator is the point where those worlds meet, sharpened further by Low Steppa’s instinct for a record that works in busy rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Low Steppa, Rue Jay, Reza (feat. Chuck Roberts) - The Creator [House]\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gXaAwj-grA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The story starts in Ibiza. Rue had just watched Carl Cox close the UNVRS grand launch party with his track I Want Your Love. “That moment was surreal,” he says. “It gave me a huge surge of motivation, and I wanted to build on that momentum by creating another record that would resonate with Carl.” Back home, he went straight into REZA’s Rezonation Studios to find the next idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>REZA picked up the thread quickly. “We decided to try and make something like an old track of mine called Galactico,” he says. While searching for the right vocal, he reached back to his early club years. “I had the idea of another track that Carl used to play in 1992 that sampled the same part of the Chuck Roberts vocal.” Dropping it into the session gave the track its identity. Rue puts it simply. “Everything just clicked.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bassline sits at the centre of the record. Rue says, “We wanted to bring a taste of the Junior Jack and Kid Crème era back for the new generation,” pointing to artists like DJ Flex and Hatiras as reference points. REZA’s take is more streamlined. “We wanted to capture the sounds from around 20 years ago in a modern yet authentic way so it worked for the current scene.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"628\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-19-01-1024x628.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82448\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-19-01-1024x628.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-19-01-300x184.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-19-01-768x471.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-19-01.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The early club reaction shaped the final mix more than any studio plan. “We made it on Friday,” Rue says. “I sent it to my mate Carl Cox on the Saturday and it was played on the Sunday.” REZA describes the response as “massive” and says they barely touched it afterwards. Rue enjoys the speed of it all. “Some would say I jumped the gun. I prefer to go with I took my chance.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Low Steppa entered the project when Rue sent him an early version. “He instantly loved what we had done and asked us to send him the stems immediately,” Rue says. REZA adds, “His knowledge of how a track works on the dance floor and then him playing it was a great way to judge if we had it right.” Low Steppa pitched it to Toolroom, where it was signed “within 5 minutes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handling Chuck Roberts’ voice meant keeping the production lean. Rue says, “With such a legendary vocal, there was nothing that could be added to make it better.” REZA agrees. “It would have been very easy to use more of the vocal. The vocal was the last thing we added. The first version actually had my own vocal on it.” Once the Chuck Roberts sample arrived, everything else stepped back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1616\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-27-23-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82449\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-27-23-1.jpg 1080w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-27-23-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-27-23-1-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-27-23-1-768x1149.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Photo-05-09-2025-12-27-23-1-1027x1536.jpg 1027w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Creator has travelled across a wide range of sets since those early Ibiza moments. Rue says, “This track has no limits. It has been played by the biggest DJs in the world… boats, hyper clubs, intimate clubs and festival stages, and it works every time.” REZA echoes the reach. “We’ve been really surprised by the wide variety of DJs that have played it. It has worked clubs and festivals all summer which is exactly where we wanted it to be.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both hint that more archival explorations may follow, but neither is sharing details. Rue jokes, “I couldn’t possibly say. I’d be giving the game away.” REZA keeps it simple. “We always have lots of ideas on this. Watch this space.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>The Creator is out now on Toolroom</em></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/low-steppa-rue-jay-and-reza-rebuild-a-house-touchstone-on-the-creator/\">Low Steppa, Rue Jay and REZA Rebuild a House Touchstone on The Creator</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

After his well-received full-length &#8220;Oktopus Mekaniks&#8221; established him in underground club circuits, this new release refines his unique approach &#8211; sampling his own acoustic drum kit, sequencing it digitally, and essentially creating a &#8220;shortcut between the computer and himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead single &#8220;Shortcut Jenny&#8221; perfectly demonstrates this hybrid POV. Built around hunting-horn samples (courtesy of a friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s obscure record) and VAAGUE&#8217;s own voice, the track evolved from a happy accident &#8211; a digital synth preset that accidentally dropped pitch became the massive bass drop that anchors the UK Garage groove. Jennifer Lawrence interview snippets provide texture without imposing meaning, letting listeners create their own narrative. It&#8217;s the kind of innovative production approach you&#8217;d expect from someone who spent years mastering jazz before diving into electronic music from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes VAAGUE&#8217;s trajectory compelling is how completely he&#8217;s committed to this electronic persona. Starting with downtempo experiments on his 2021 self-titled EP, collaborating with Le Motel on 2022&#8217;s dancefloor-focused &#8220;From the Ashes,&#8221; and now fully embracing faster tempos and live playability on &#8220;SHORTCUT,&#8221; he&#8217;s methodically building a unique sonic identity. His background as a jazz bandleader informs everything &#8211; the complex choreography of his live stick performances, the compositional sophistication underlying even his most club-ready tracks. &#8220;SHORTCUT&#8221; proves the detour through jazz was actually the most direct route to somewhere genuinely original.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2KfrQENbQ6yI3Hmiki9iKy?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/401707/\">VAAGUE Teases Boundary-pushing EP with Lead Single &#8216;Shortcut Jenny&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

Another reminder that no one does high-tech minimal quite like Boris. <em>– Danielle Carty</em></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2tj1iOLK9Uwef7ooLgJMtJ?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/zenith/pl.u-38oWMM4FPbPMamB\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iammaesic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maesic</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/10/dancing-astronauts-new-music-friday-maesic-boris-brejcha-dimension-and-more-october-31-2025/\">Dancing Astronaut’s New Music Friday: Maesic, Boris Brejcha, Dimension, and more (October 31, 2025)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

The world-renowned electronic producer has announced his first full-length studio album in nearly a decade. This is massive news for the newcomers and the seasoned dance music goers. The album is set for release in 2026. Kicking off this long-awaited new era, he drops “Ameonna”, a lush, cinematic instrumental out today via his <a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=mau5trap\">mau5trap</a> label.</p>\n<p>Building from shimmering atmospherics to an electrified storm of synths, “Ameonna” evokes the raw precision and texture that made deadmau5 a household name with tracks like “Faxing Berlin” and “Some Chords.” It’s both nostalgic and forward-looking — a sonic bridge between his legacy and his next chapter.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all. deadmau5 is officially retiring his iconic Cube production and debuting an entirely new live show this November 7 &#038; 8 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. The five-hour set will feature his techno alter-ego testpilot, new music from the upcoming album, and even a mau5 drum &amp; bass segment to close out the night — all wrapped in cutting-edge visuals and fresh stage design.</p>\n<p>To celebrate, Denver will host a two-day mau5hop pop-up at 95 S Cherokee Street, open from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fans can grab exclusive merch, including hoodies, vinyl, hats, and even a limited Atari x deadmau5 “Meowingtons’ Revenge” playable cartridge. deadmau5 himself will be there for meet-and-greets each day from noon to 3 p.m. Entry is free and open to all ages.</p>\n<p>With “Ameonna,” a new album on the horizon, and a fresh live experience about to debut, deadmau5 isn’t just returning — he’s reinventing.</p>\n<p>deadmau5 &#8211; Ameonna |</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2184808187&#038;color=%23cc0000&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" title=\"deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deadmau5</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5/ameonna\" title=\"Ameonna\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ameonna</a></div>\n<p>“Follow” deadmau5 : | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=1fe640-1-1721663343551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=561c75-1-1721663343551\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soundcloud</a> |</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/2025/10/deadmau5-new-single-ameonna-new-album-new-red-rocks-show/\">deadmau5 Is Back: New Single “Ameonna,” New Album, New Red Rocks Show</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com\">thissongslaps.com - Electronic Dance Music &amp; Hip-Hop Media</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bass n Babes Records, a label focused on showcasing femme and gender-expansive folx, returns with a 13-track project featuring new and emerging artists. </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Summer 2025 marked the banging debut of <a href=\"http://edmidentity.com/tag/bass-n-babes-records\"><strong>Bass n Babes</strong> <strong>Records</strong></a>, an offshoot label of the collective <a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/bass-n-babes/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"26662\"><strong>Bass n Babes</strong></a>. Created to celebrate marginalized genders in the bass scene, this independent imprint provides a safe space for women, queer, non-binary, and trans artists, with a focus on bass music.&nbsp;Their second compilation, <em><strong>Bass n Babes Vol. II</strong></em>&nbsp;continues its mission of bridging the gap between community and music, offering thirteen songs of pure, unadulterated underground sound and wobble bass.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bass n Babes Vol. II</em> is as diverse in music as it is in its lineup, featuring an array of new and returning artists. Marking her first foray onto the Bass n Babes label is <strong>TrebleTina</strong>, whose intergalactic opener, “<strong>Spaceship to Nirvana</strong>,” is a sonic journey to other worlds. The hypnotic vocals and heavy basslines showcase why she’s Insomniac’s recent Project GLOW 2025 Discovery Project winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/baby-kush/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"26663\">Baby Kush</a></strong>, <strong>nomi</strong>, and <strong>VIOLET</strong> have also returned to take listeners on a psychedelic journey. Bass n Babes founder Baby Kush’s “<strong>On a Trip</strong>” combines dreamy vocals with deep bass, while nomi and VIOLET’s “<strong>Free</strong>” features melodic bass and trippy, atmospheric vibes. Newcomers <strong>ETHERA</strong> and <strong>IIBARRA</strong> both go hard with their styles of drum and bass, with ETHERA’S “<strong>Trinity</strong>&#8221; keeping things on the minimal side. IIBARRA’s “<strong>Science is Sexy</strong>” dabbles in breaks with a seductive vocal before crashing into heavy DnB. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a male-dominated world, it’s refreshing to see more femme and queer individuals taking the reins and delivering some high-quality bass bangers. The album does a good job of seamlessly blending songs into one another, and it runs the gamut from experimental, dubstep, DnB, UK garage, and trap. One thing’s sure, <em>Bass n Babes Vol. II</em> delivers on the low end frequencies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stream <em>Bass n Babes Vol. II </em>on Spotify or on your <a href=\"https://too.fm/oz8rppn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">preferred platform</a>, and follow Bass n Babes on social media to hear what they come up with next. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stream Various Artists &#8211; <em>Bass n Babes Vol. II </em>on Spotify:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Bass n Babes Vol. II\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1s6ayTgh6XbzTmHZS9Y68J?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Various Artists &#8211; <em>Bass n Babes Vol. II</em> &#8211; Tracklist:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>TrebleTina &#8211; Spaceship to Nirvana</li>\n\n\n\n<li>nomi, VIOLET &#8211; Free</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Baby Kush &#8211; On a Trip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Trowl &#8211; Oblivion Wing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>two girls one laptop, Kurei, Auracle &#8211; desire&lt;3</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ETHERA &#8211; Trinity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lex Looper &#8211; Moment of Clarity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>IIBARRA &#8211; Science is Sexy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ROSES Grimoire &#8211; Thirst TRAP</li>\n\n\n\n<li>farley, Hersoul &#8211; CROWN</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sorcerist- tócame</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MICROPLASTIQUE &#8211; RHYTHM FREQ</li>\n\n\n\n<li>aariaa &#8211; Can We Go Back</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-medium\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bnb-vol-ii-artwork-V2_Square-500x500.png\" alt=\"Bass n Babes Vol. II Album\" class=\"wp-image-271272\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bnb-vol-ii-artwork-V2_Square-500x500.png 500w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bnb-vol-ii-artwork-V2_Square-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bnb-vol-ii-artwork-V2_Square-150x150.png 150w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bnb-vol-ii-artwork-V2_Square-768x768.png 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bnb-vol-ii-artwork-V2_Square-1536x1536.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow Bass n Babes:</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bassnbabes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bassnbabesrecords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/bass.n.babes.records/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/bass-n-babes\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://soundcloud.com/bass-n-babes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SoundCloud</a> | <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@BassnBabes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a> | <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bass.n.babes\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@bass.n.babes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com/2025/11/17/bass-n-babes-vol-ii/\">Bass n Babes Records Releases Sophomore Compilation Album, &#8216;Bass n Babes Vol. II&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com\">EDM Identity</a>.</p>\n",
