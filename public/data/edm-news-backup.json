      "fullContent": "\n<p>The world’s wettest party and one of the most attended music festival in the world, <strong>S2O</strong>, finally hit the U.S. for the first making its official debut in sunny Los Angeles. Matched with an all-star lineup such as <strong>Steve Aoki, AFROJACK, R3HAB, Elephante, Yetep</strong>, and many more. The event is also known for introducing some new acts and sunny SoCal met for the first time two well-known Hong Kong artists, <strong>Eric Kwok </strong>and <strong>Dan James</strong>, for their debut as super duo, <strong>HO HO ONE</strong>. The name in Cantonese means “lucky” and the DJ duo were just as bright as the sun that day living up to their moniker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HO HO ONE got to sit down with EDM Tunes right after their set and the vibes were just right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing up overseas, what musical influences shaped you most, and how do you bring that local sound into a global stage like this?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: Cantonese music is super powerful for me. You know, such a huge part of my life, and I want to be, you know, that that bridge that gap to be able to share that music with the rest of the world. It’s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Well, for me, it’s all those pop stars in Hong Kong, but actually the music that influenced me the most would be The Beatles, because they’re just a lot of a good pop tunes. And then I went off to listen to all these synth pop music from Europe. So, we’ve witnessed the whole electronic thing start. I’ve never stopped since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does blending Cantopop with EDM reflect who you are as artists from Asia?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Wow, it’s just I’m from Asia so it totally reflects my work, I’ve never stopped listening to EDM. I’ve witnessed the change of it. I’m glad I’m in a position where I can bring these different elements to it now. I hope people when they listen to EDM. I’m thinking, feel something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a duo, how do you balance your individual personalities and tastes when creating tracks together?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Yeah, we are so different as a person. He’s like always full of energy, right Dan? Are you not? I’m like an “I” person, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I think we have a perfect partnership like, I have the energy, but Eric’s like the mastermind, you know always in the studio with these incredible ideas, because obviously, he’s like the old classic singer songwriter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: He’s a performer, so we kind of like bounce off of each other. I totally need him!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: The balance that we have is actually what makes you HO HO ONE, you know? When the crowds sees us, they can feel both of our energies, and then what we could both bring to the table. Yeah, the crowd can definitely feel that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: But the one good thing is as different as we are, our taste in EDM is actually very similar. Like he would come to me with all these hundreds of songs and I’m looking at least 50 of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We have a lot of fun putting the actual set together, especially with the “Canto-influence” into it which Eric did all the production, and all the work behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: You sang! You didn’t know any Cantonese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We actually went to studio. We were like breaking it down, and I was recording it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: This guy is one of the smartest guys I’ve ever met because I mean, Cantonese is really hard. But he can learn this and sing it in just 4 hours!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s the bigger perfectionist in the studio?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I will definitely say– No! I think I bring a lot of ideas to the table and then we brainstorm and Eric is with the execution . I mean, because it’s like in barely years of experience,? He’s the master behind it. And we brainstorm and discuss, and then Eric is the one who can put everything together so seamlessly, you know the way it’s done is just incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: When I was younger, I used to be anal about stuff. But now, I just say fuck it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Today is your first American festival performance — what’s running through your minds right now, and how did you prepare?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: The only thing that’s in my mind is “Don’t screw up”. I know I did [jokingly].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We wanted to leave the audience, the crowd with the impression of HO HO ONE, right? Our feeling even before the show was the nerves, which was turning into excitement and adrenaline. Once we were up, I think you know, we just went into autopilot. With all the years of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: I just want to make it clear while I was up there, I was really focused on the buttons. I didn’t see any bikinis. My wife is here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.Since many in the crowd may not understand Cantonese, how do you want them to feel when they hear your music live?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: Eric’s genius. We had actually eight of our original Canto songs, which Eric transformed into lan EDM track, the beauty of it is that you can see the reaction from the crowds and they were just so buzzin’, and, loving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Totally. I mean, EDM, as long as you get the kick and the bass right, and the groove, people will dance to it. It could be in Spanish, and can be in Korean. So now, I don’t see why not Cantonese?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: The way you put tracks together. It’s pure and genius.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s the biggest difference you’ve noticed so far between the music scene in Asia and here in the U.S.?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: I think in America, they like dubstep a bit more than Asia. Asia is house? Tech house? Techno?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I think that opens to more genre assumptions, right? So, in Asia, I think it can be a little bit more reserved sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: The music brought back some really dance classics from the early 90s, Y2K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s the first American snack or store you’ve fallen in love with since landing here?</strong> (rapid-fire)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I never ate In-N-Out before. Eric, recommended it to me. It changed my life. Store-wise, I think CVS since it’s open 24 hours, it’s just so convenient. And inside, you can find everything that you need at the moment in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: We actually had two meals at KTown. Korean Barbeque. It was so good. We got it twice in two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: It feels like three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could collaborate with any American artist right now, who would it be and why?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: It would be Skrillex for sure. He changed things epically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: Yeah, I think the respect I have for the top 10 like that gets up, Calvin Harris? He’s always been my idol as well. I hope they became how they started to where they are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: But in terms of dubstep, I really like Illenium, but I’m not sure if he’s from America or Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After this festival debut, what kind of legacy do you hope HO HO ONE will leave as a Hong Kong duo pushing Cantopop into the EDM world?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"10\" class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We want to make sure that we would love to open the Canto music to the Western world. I think, you ,now, they’re missing out the old school songs, especially many songs that Eric wrote for the big stars, Eason Chan, etc. At least he’s on there, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: He said that it was some content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I have nothing but love for this legend. Nothing but love for this legend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: There are a lot of good melodies or top lines from all these Canto-pop songs.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>The world’s wettest party and one of the most attended music festival in the world, <strong>S2O</strong>, finally hit the U.S. for the first making its official debut in sunny Los Angeles. Matched with an all-star lineup such as <strong>Steve Aoki, AFROJACK, R3HAB, Elephante, Yetep</strong>, and many more. The event is also known for introducing some new acts and sunny SoCal met for the first time two well-known Hong Kong artists, <strong>Eric Kwok </strong>and <strong>Dan James</strong>, for their debut as super duo, <strong>HO HO ONE</strong>. The name in Cantonese means “lucky” and the DJ duo were just as bright as the sun that day living up to their moniker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HO HO ONE got to sit down with EDM Tunes right after their set and the vibes were just right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Growing up overseas, what musical influences shaped you most, and how do you bring that local sound into a global stage like this?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: Cantonese music is super powerful for me. You know, such a huge part of my life, and I want to be, you know, that that bridge that gap to be able to share that music with the rest of the world. It’s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Well, for me, it’s all those pop stars in Hong Kong, but actually the music that influenced me the most would be The Beatles, because they’re just a lot of a good pop tunes. And then I went off to listen to all these synth pop music from Europe. So, we’ve witnessed the whole electronic thing start. I’ve never stopped since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does blending Cantopop with EDM reflect who you are as artists from Asia?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Wow, it’s just I’m from Asia so it totally reflects my work, I’ve never stopped listening to EDM. I’ve witnessed the change of it. I’m glad I’m in a position where I can bring these different elements to it now. I hope people when they listen to EDM. I’m thinking, feel something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>As a duo, how do you balance your individual personalities and tastes when creating tracks together?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Yeah, we are so different as a person. He’s like always full of energy, right Dan? Are you not? I’m like an “I” person, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I think we have a perfect partnership like, I have the energy, but Eric’s like the mastermind, you know always in the studio with these incredible ideas, because obviously, he’s like the old classic singer songwriter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: He’s a performer, so we kind of like bounce off of each other. I totally need him!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: The balance that we have is actually what makes you HO HO ONE, you know? When the crowds sees us, they can feel both of our energies, and then what we could both bring to the table. Yeah, the crowd can definitely feel that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: But the one good thing is as different as we are, our taste in EDM is actually very similar. Like he would come to me with all these hundreds of songs and I’m looking at least 50 of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We have a lot of fun putting the actual set together, especially with the “Canto-influence” into it which Eric did all the production, and all the work behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: You sang! You didn’t know any Cantonese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We actually went to studio. We were like breaking it down, and I was recording it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: This guy is one of the smartest guys I’ve ever met because I mean, Cantonese is really hard. But he can learn this and sing it in just 4 hours!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who’s the bigger perfectionist in the studio?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I will definitely say– No! I think I bring a lot of ideas to the table and then we brainstorm and Eric is with the execution . I mean, because it’s like in barely years of experience,? He’s the master behind it. And we brainstorm and discuss, and then Eric is the one who can put everything together so seamlessly, you know the way it’s done is just incredible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: When I was younger, I used to be anal about stuff. But now, I just say fuck it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Today is your first American festival performance — what’s running through your minds right now, and how did you prepare?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: The only thing that’s in my mind is “Don’t screw up”. I know I did [jokingly].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We wanted to leave the audience, the crowd with the impression of HO HO ONE, right? Our feeling even before the show was the nerves, which was turning into excitement and adrenaline. Once we were up, I think you know, we just went into autopilot. With all the years of experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: I just want to make it clear while I was up there, I was really focused on the buttons. I didn’t see any bikinis. My wife is here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6.Since many in the crowd may not understand Cantonese, how do you want them to feel when they hear your music live?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: Eric’s genius. We had actually eight of our original Canto songs, which Eric transformed into lan EDM track, the beauty of it is that you can see the reaction from the crowds and they were just so buzzin’, and, loving it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: Totally. I mean, EDM, as long as you get the kick and the bass right, and the groove, people will dance to it. It could be in Spanish, and can be in Korean. So now, I don’t see why not Cantonese?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: The way you put tracks together. It’s pure and genius.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s the biggest difference you’ve noticed so far between the music scene in Asia and here in the U.S.?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: I think in America, they like dubstep a bit more than Asia. Asia is house? Tech house? Techno?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I think that opens to more genre assumptions, right? So, in Asia, I think it can be a little bit more reserved sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: The music brought back some really dance classics from the early 90s, Y2K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s the first American snack or store you’ve fallen in love with since landing here?</strong> (rapid-fire)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I never ate In-N-Out before. Eric, recommended it to me. It changed my life. Store-wise, I think CVS since it’s open 24 hours, it’s just so convenient. And inside, you can find everything that you need at the moment in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: We actually had two meals at KTown. Korean Barbeque. It was so good. We got it twice in two days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: It feels like three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could collaborate with any American artist right now, who would it be and why?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: It would be Skrillex for sure. He changed things epically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: Yeah, I think the respect I have for the top 10 like that gets up, Calvin Harris? He’s always been my idol as well. I hope they became how they started to where they are now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: But in terms of dubstep, I really like Illenium, but I’m not sure if he’s from America or Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After this festival debut, what kind of legacy do you hope HO HO ONE will leave as a Hong Kong duo pushing Cantopop into the EDM world?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol start=\"10\" class=\"wp-block-list\"></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: We want to make sure that we would love to open the Canto music to the Western world. I think, you ,now, they’re missing out the old school songs, especially many songs that Eric wrote for the big stars, Eason Chan, etc. At least he’s on there, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: He said that it was some content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dan: I have nothing but love for this legend. Nothing but love for this legend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric: There are a lot of good melodies or top lines from all these Canto-pop songs. And I think you can take those and put ‘em in the EDM and it’ll be refreshing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-scaled.jpg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392618\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-1920x1280.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/S20LA2025_0927_173840-08537_IME-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/ho-ho-one-brings-cantopop-and-edm-to-s2o-in-u-s-debut/\">HO HO ONE Brings Cantopop and EDM to S2O in U.S. Debut</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>As <strong>EDC Orlando</strong> attendees return to reality, there has been perhaps an outsized focus on crowd flow concerns at <strong>EDC Orlando 2025</strong>. As the festival wrapped and many attendees shared their amazing experiences on social media, some attendees took to social media to complain about the crowds, feeling that the issues from 2024 had not been improved enough. Insomniac and its entire team take all comments very seriously, with Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella sharing a statement on social media on Monday evening to address the concerns about crowd flow and water stations. </p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FPasqualeRotella%2Fposts%2Fpfbid07NU4KUDtguBPbCWQxg36TmD2JCpmfsU2yw9G3iMusXyDMYNDDtrPbYm98hWTKBCpl&#038;show_text=true&#038;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"718\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>To show just how receptive Insomniac is to attendee feedback, the company gave us time with its <strong>Executive Producer for EDC, Matthew Smit</strong>. We talked about the layout changes, crowd flow management, and water stations. The overall message is that Insomniac hears you and EDC is always working on ways to provide a better experience for everybody.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-congestion-not-crowd-crush\">Congestion Not &#8220;Crowd Crush&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &#8220;crowd crush,&#8221; which has been used in some social media comments, creates a false impression of what happened. A &#8220;crowd crush&#8221; is what happened at the infamous Astroworld, where a stampede occurs and leads to death or serious bodily injury due to asphyxiation or trampling. Nothing like this happened at EDC Orlando. In fact, there were no medical calls related to the crowd congestion that occurred Sunday.<br> <br>Crowd congestion, on the other hand, is when you have a high density of people in a confined area leading to restricted movement. This happens in festivals when the flow of people temporarily exceeds the capacity of a certain area of the overall venue. This often leads to feelings of anxiety or panic. Urgent crowd control measures can be put in place to deal with this. EDC did deploy its Ground Control team to help direct the crowd flow so that the various directions of flow were directed in different areas. EDC Orlando did manage the crowds to avoid any type of crowd crush, but crowd congestion takes finer tuning and is always an evolving process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-venue-changes-amp-future-plans\">Venue Changes &amp; Future Plans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>EDC did, in fact, make a lot of changes from 2024 to 2025 to help alleviate crowd congestion. At all stages the areas were opened up more to allow more capacity, whether it was by moving food and beverage areas further away or by removing brand activation stages in the area. The most &#8220;controversial&#8221; change was moving the water stations. The festival previously had a water station in that major crowd congestion area near VIP at Circuit Grounds, which amplified the congestion in 2024. Moving this did alleviate that particular congestion, and it allowed people to spread more evenly throughout the venue. In the past, EDC found that even with multiple stations, people tended to use just one and left the others mostly empty. In the area between Circuit Grounds and SteroBloom, some container walls used to enclose certain spaces were removed. Certain pathways were moved around the venue as well. Also, as many things as possible were moved within the stadium to free up more space outside for people to move. <br>From my own experience, I noticed less congestion in the perimeter around the stadium, although the situation was the worst on Sunday due to the rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-schedule-changes\">Schedule Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artist bookings were scheduled to better control crowd flow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-capacity\">Capacity </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While people throw around the term &#8220;overselling&#8221; a lot, the festival had the sold the same number of tickets as last year. There are 100,000 attendees per day, and the busiest day in terms of attendance was Saturday. Sunday notably had the lowest attendance of the three days, which is pretty commonplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rain\">Rain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The congestion issue was primarily noticeable on Sunday, and yet that was the day with the lowest attendance. The reason both things are true is because of the rain and the temporary shutdown of the stages. Early in the day the stages were shut down, meaning everybody had to quickly move to a shelter location until the lightning passed. This caused a lot of muddy areas to develop, where people would no longer walk or stand once the “all clear” was given. Essentially, this situation cut off numerous pathways and forced everybody to follow whatever dry pathways could be found.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>EDC is paying particular attention to this issue and how to mitigate it in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-constantly-evolving\">Constantly Evolving</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To close out the conversation, Insomniac stressed that EDC Orlando is a constant process of evolution and growth. On top of that, it&#8217;s important to remember that out of the 300,000 people that attended over the weekend, the vast majority had an amazing time, myself included. It&#8217;s not unusual for certain people to have a bad experience, and Insomniac hears them, but this negative impression being spread on forums is not reflective of reality. The festival is always making changes based on feedback and experiences to make things better. Insomniac says nothing is off the table in terms of potential ways to improve crowd flow issues in the future, and explained a number of potential &#8220;outside the box&#8221; ideas they are considering to improve the situation and expand the available space in the coming years. The bottom line is that the situation will keep getting better and the festival will continue to be an amazing experience</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/insomniac-addresses-edc-orlando-crowd-flow-concerns/\">Insomniac Addresses EDC Orlando Crowd Flow Concerns</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Our bodies are still feeling the high vibrations from this past weekend, and as usual, we return home with our hearts full. <strong>Electric Daisy Carnival in Orlando</strong> engulfed us with fantastic sets and divine energy. <strong>Tinker Field</strong> hosted tens of thousands of <strong>&#8220;headliners&#8221; </strong>for three days of absolute mayhem. Once again, we&#8217;re happy to discuss our favorite moments from the weekend, as well as feedback we hope can improve the event even more. Let&#8217;s do it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s crazy to reflect on how far this festival has come and how much it has grown from its inception in 2011. Even 10 years ago, the festival was much smaller than it is today, with fewer stages, fewer people, and fewer days. In 2025, EDC Orlando is executing at such a high level that you can readily compare it with flagship festivals like Tomorrowland and Ultra. The production, lineup, and scale are definitely at that type of level. The festival plans to continue growing and improving, with <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/10/pasquale-rotella-interview/\">Camping World Stadium set to undergo a major renovation beginning next month</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392542\" style=\"width:534px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/580804003_18366661324086386_2516404383957177088_n.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-production\">Production</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Extravagant and maximalist, EDC Orlando remains one of the highest quality events on the East Coast. Giant screens, beautiful structures, character designs, interactive installations, carnival games, pyrotechnics, and drone shows this year continued the trend. Every single stage had enough space for dancers and/or aerial performers. The mainstage design was one of our favorites in years. Neon Garden had one of our favorite upgrades compared to other years. It may not be our preferred warehouse structure from 2021, but the visuals, the crowd, and the underground feeling to the stage kept us there for hours.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392544\" style=\"width:607px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-1920x1281.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n-630x420.jpg 630w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/579194454_1387094676105288_1209885063794479003_n.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This year, the Kandi Casino became a fan favorite activity. Also brought out during EDC Las Vegas and EDSEA, the Kandi-making party became accessible in the middle of the festival, instead of just at the VIP areas. There&#8217;s also plenty of cool brand activations across the festival grounds, with one of our favorites being the <strong>Casa Bacardi</strong>. It&#8217;s actually a fully equipped stage with its own lineup and specialty drinks. It&#8217;s definitely one you want to check out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rain may have affected logistics on Sunday afternoon, which stopped the music for about an hour. Nonetheless, the festival continued operations as effectively as possible. The mud affected certain areas on each stage, which then caused bottlenecks during crowd flow.Some attendees had some concerns regarding the crowd pinch points and the water station this year, which was moved to one large location as opposed to a few smaller ones in past years. In response, Pasquale Rotella, the Insomniac CEO, released the following statement:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ7zNNnEpT_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

A large water station has enough capacity for all and it moved the crowd of people away from the choke points. The problem was that early Sunday rain showers caused the grounds to get muddy which meant people were hop-skipping and jumping around or avoiding muddy areas. This severely narrowed the available walking spaces for people, creating a tighter situation than normal. Pasquale Rotella previously explained to EDMTunes that the festival is never oversold and capacity is constantly monitored live via scans of wristbands at various locations. It&#8217;s really an art of scheduling enough counterprogramming and creating a smart crowd flow. Insomniac has plans to expand the grounds in the future, but they involve purchasing land and demolishing </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-music\">The Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year&#8217;s lineup saw some of the strongest performances of the year. Major highlights include the GIRLBOSS herself <strong>Sara Landry </strong>at Kinetic Field, dropping insane high-bpms and tasteful unreleased IDs, S<strong>VDDEN DEATH&#8217;s VOYD </strong>set took us to the underworld with heavy Bass and Trippy textures, and<strong> Charlotte de Witte </strong>melted our brains off with an Acid heavy set to celebrate her debut album release. </p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DQyK1a3jot-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Sets such as <strong>San Pacho and OMNON</strong> gave us groove and powerful emotions to dance the night away. Moreover, <strong>Chris Lake</strong> commanded the audience with his sultry and warm undertones. Lastly, <strong>Green Velvet b2b Alok</strong> delivered a performance for the books. Other incredible sets included <strong>Seven Lions</strong> taking us on a journey with Psytrance, Dubstep, Trap, Midtempo, and Hard Techno, and<strong> Indira Paganotto&#8217;s Psytechno</strong> wonderland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And who can forget Friday performances from <strong>Argy </strong>and <strong>Porter Robinson</strong> on the mainstage, while Adam Beyer&#8217;s <strong>Drumcode</strong> artists were slaying the crowd over at Neon Garden with <strong>Bart Skils, Kevin de Vries, Adam Beyer, and Layton Giordani</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-overview\">Overview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We truly believe EDC Orlando is one of the most consistent festivals in terms of vibes, music selection, production, and logistics. The weather on Sunday affected operations momentarily, yet artists delivered top-notch tracks and memories. Moreover, the City of Orlando approved the proposed<strong> $400 million Camping World Stadium renovation</strong>, which could potentially benefit and upgrade Tinker Field for the upcoming years, as Pasquale has mentioned before. It may be over, but EDC will return next year, taking over <strong>Mexico, Thailand</strong>, and the newest location in <strong>Medellin, Colombia</strong>. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/event-review-edc-orlando-2025-reaches-new-heights/\">[Event Review] EDC Orlando 2025 Reaches New Heights</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

The track is further enriched by a powerful, emotional vocal from&nbsp;<strong>Carte Blanche</strong>, who delivers the poignant refrain: “I fell in love with the city.” Already a highlight in DJ sets across the globe, &#8216;The City&#8217; is perfectly primed to become a defining new dancefloor anthem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-shared-history-fuels-the-collaboration\">A Shared History Fuels the Collaboration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration between the two artists is a deeply personal one, rooted in a shared history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alex Wann</strong>&nbsp;shared:&nbsp;<em>&#8220;Jeremie (Notre Dame) and I have known each other for over ten years — friends from the same hometown. &#8216;The City&#8217; came together naturally.

Over the past decade, he’s built a career rooted in rhythm and connection – spending the last four years refining his craft under his current alias. As co-founder of Casa Bonita Records alongside Brisotti, Viot has championed a sound steeped in Latin influence, curating music that’s as vibrant and dynamic as the culture that inspires it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With releases on premier imprints like Solid Grooves, Black Book Records, and Higher Ground, Viot has quickly positioned himself as one of house music’s most exciting rising talents. His recent performances at Ushuaïa Ibiza for ANTS, Mochakk Is Calling in Malta, Hï Ibiza, and UNVRS Ibiza – where he performed at the invitation of Carl Cox – showcase an artist fully hitting his stride. Whether behind the decks or in the studio, Viot continues to evolve while keeping groove and energy at the heart of his work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now signed to Analog Agency in North America, Viot is taking his sound worldwide. A U.S. tour is set for March 2026, followed by a European run in July and August, marking the biggest chapter of his career to date. His upcoming releases – including “Fyrah,” dropping December 19 via Italian label Moan – capture his signature style: sophisticated, dance floor–ready, and deeply connected to Latin rhythm. With his global footprint expanding fast, Viot is stepping into his most exciting era yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"V.Rec Vol. 05 - Mercado Novo BH\" width=\"900\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3cx7f2f0dE?start=2&#038;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/juniorsousa/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Junior Sousa</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/brazils-viot-expands-global-reach-ahead-of-2026-u-s-and-european-tour-plus-upcoming-single-fyrah/\">Brazil&#8217;s Viot expands global reach ahead of 2026 U.S. and European tour, plus upcoming single “Fyrah”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

Expect hypnotic techno from <strong>Sara Landry</strong> and <strong>Maceo Plex</strong>, deep grooves from <strong>Lee Burridge</strong> and <strong>Hot Since 82</strong>, and euphoric selections from <strong>Jayda G</strong>, <strong>J. Worra</strong>, and <strong>Rodriguez Jr.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the heavier side, <strong>Zeds Dead</strong>, <strong>Of The Trees</strong>, and <strong>ALLEYCVT</strong> are bringing the thunder, while <strong>Dimension</strong>, <strong>Ivy Lab</strong>, and <strong>Flava D</strong> lead a powerhouse drum &amp; bass takeover. UKG favorites like <strong>Conducta</strong>, <strong>Oppidan</strong>, and <strong>Main Phase</strong> round out the vibe with that unmistakable bounce.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because it’s LIB, there’s no shortage of curveballs: <strong>Overmono</strong>, <strong>Avalon Emerson</strong>, <strong>DJ HEARTSTRING</strong>, and <strong>Tripolism</strong> are all on deck, alongside live performances from <strong>KAMAUU</strong>, <strong>Noga Erez</strong>, <strong>Midnight Generation</strong>, and <strong>Empire of the Sun’s</strong> unmissable visual spectacle. Even drag icon <strong>DJ Trixie Mattel</strong> is returning after her surprise Coachella Do LaB debut last yea, talk about range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-than-a-festival-it-s-a-feeling\"><strong>More Than a Festival — It’s a Feeling</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve been, you know. LIB isn’t just about who’s playing, it’s about <em>what happens</em> in between. Sunrise yoga on the lake, spontaneous jam sessions, strangers becoming family at <strong>The Compass</strong> or <strong>The Grand Artique</strong>, and art that feels alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every corner of the festival holds something unexpected from immersive installations to hidden pop-ups and mind-opening talks. This year’s <strong>Crossroads stage</strong> will once again feature SoCal favorites like <strong>A Club Called Rhonda</strong>, <strong>Respect DnB</strong>, <strong>Baile World</strong>, and <strong>FMLY BZNS</strong>, curating late-night takeovers that embody the heart of California’s underground.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ7ZjSQknUi/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

There’s no way that Melbourne Instruments’ Delia, one of the best hybrid synthesizers on the market today, is going for almost 50% off. But it is. Thomann has it for £1244, or 46% off the usual price. This. Is. Unbelievable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So why all the hyperbole? Delia is a six-voice polyphonic synthesizer with four digital oscillators per voice, including virtual analogue, wavetable, and more; an analogue Ladder lowpass filter with both 2-pole and 4-pole slopes; a VA highpass filter; three LFOs and three envelopes; a mod matrix, stereo effects, and more. And it has those incredibly cool motorised knobs based on drone motor technology. Seriously. It’s bananas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of course, all of this wouldn’t mean anything if Delia didn’t sound the business, but it does. This is such a good deal.

Inspired by the Juno-106 (although not strictly a clone), they’re highly regarded for their sound quality – and the onboard TC Electronic and Klark Teknik effects don’t hurt either.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>DeepMind 6X is the six-voice version, with the X designating that it’s one of the newer models with the Juno-like livery. Although the effects at the end of the signal chain are digital, the dual oscillators and filters are definitely analogue, with that Juno sound that electronic producers love so much. Unlike the original 106, though, this synth has two oscillators, meaning it's capable of fatter sounds than the original. There’s also a mod matrix, sequencer and arpeggiator, and those effects, which can really transform the sound.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Honestly, if you only ever buy one Behringer synth, this is probably the one to get.

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

It combines energetic music for the dancefloor with deeper emotional moments. One notable track is <strong>&#8216;Ride&#8217;</strong>, which features a bright 80s disco sound updated with modern production. It stands out for its lively neon synths and fun energy, offering a nice contrast to the album&#8217;s quieter parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Petrichor\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2lti3xxEJ9Yta59kUAq0Eg?si=muOAtxbXQu-bPhZAXwvO1g&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-petrichor-the-album-that-klangkarussell-brought-out-to-get-the-emotions-flowing-instantly\"><em>Petrichor</em>, the album that Klangkarussell brought out to get the emotions flowing instantly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The album opens with <strong>&#8216;Truth Begins&#8217;</strong>, featuring <strong>Blazey</strong>. This song includes catchy melodies, exciting breakdowns, and a strong beat. It captures the feelings of facing one&#8217;s truth and serves as both a dancefloor hit and an emotional release.

This song tells a personal story about family life during wartime in Ukraine. <strong>&#8216;The Tide&#8217;</strong>, featuring <strong>Elmar</strong>, mixes haunting vocals with rich sounds. <strong>&#8216;Sun Went Down, Sky Went Dark&#8217;</strong>, featuring <strong>GIVVEN</strong> and <strong>Senes</strong>, combines melodic and Afro house styles into a beautiful anthem perfect for sunsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-album-is-a-great-step-in-the-vibrant-careers-of-klangkarussell\">The album is a great step in the vibrant careers of Klangkarussell</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With help from artists like Blazey, GIVVEN, Bloom Twins, <strong>Oliva</strong>, <strong>Redward Martin</strong>, <strong>Elmar</strong>, <strong>Marieme</strong>, and Senes, <em>Petrichor</em> shows Klangkarussell&#8217;s growth.

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation. His &#8220;One Sound, Two Sides&#8221; philosophy translates into production that feels equally at home during peak-time festival moments and those rare club instances when everyone actually connects with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What separates this from typical progressive fare is TR3AL&#8217;s stated ambition beyond the booth. He&#8217;s developing a fully immersive live show incorporating visuals and motion-capture characters, treating each release as a narrative chapter rather than isolated singles. That cinematic storytelling approach is already evident in &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; &#8211; the track builds with genuine dramatic arc rather than just hitting familiar progressive house checkpoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a debut album and live show planned for 2026, TR3AL&#8217;s positioning himself as more than another festival circuit DJ. &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; captures what he describes as &#8220;the rush of energy you feel when you&#8217;re fully present&#8221; &#8211; ambitious conceptual framework aside, the track simply works as both emotional statement and dancefloor weapon. That balance is harder to achieve than it sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6CtNFlZYtifblpZy7SGASX?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/tr3al-gets-into-the-feels-on-never-ending-love/\">TR3AL gets into the feels on &#8216;Never Ending Love&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

At each corner there are various food joints, amenities such as the Beauty Bar, and plenty of space to roam around. On the outer edges Headliners could find all the EDC essentials: info booths, merch tents, free water refills, and more! Light-up tunnels guide you into the colorful center of EDC and make for a great meeting spot with friends.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for a Wonderful EDC Las Vegas 2021!</h2>\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic was, and still is in many ways, a difficult time for everyone, but we are infinitely grateful to have been able to reunite with our Headliners this year Under The Electric Sky.

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

Even at its most aggressive (closing track &#8216;Liquid Fire&#8217;), &#8216;Digital Haze&#8217; is a celebration of rounded percussion, sinewave bass and a deeper, funkier and altogether smoother take on Techno. There&#8217;s no lack of power, though, with opener &#8216;Aria&#8217;, the title track and the clipped swing of &#8216;Overseen&#8217; providing relentless hip-shaking grooves that could run well beyond their playtime.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A firm fixture in some of Techno&#8217;s most renowned clubs, including regular sessions at Berghain and a residency at Tempio Del Futuro Perduto in Milan, Elisa Bee is a DJ and producer who has focused on craft and skill, and it shows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Elisa Bee&#8217;s &#8216;Digital Haze&#8217;&nbsp;EP is released on Hardgroove&nbsp;<strong>on November 28th</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>Pre-order: <a href=\"https://bensims.bandcamp.com/album/digital-haze-ep\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://bensims.bandcamp.com/album/digital-haze-ep</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Tracklist:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">1 &#8211; Elisa Bee &#8211; Aria &#8211; Hardgroove<br />2 &#8211; Elisa Bee &#8211; Digital Haze &#8211; Hardgroove<br />3 &#8211; Elisa Bee &#8211; Overseen &#8211; Hardgroove<br />4 &#8211; Elisa Bee &#8211; Liquid Fire &#8211; Hardgroove</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Socials:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/xelisabeex/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elisa Bee Instagram</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xelisabeex\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elisa Bee Soundcloud</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hardgrooverecs/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hardgroove Instagram</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ben-sims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hardgroove Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bensims.bandcamp.com/music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hardgroove Bandcamp</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/elisa-bee-returns-to-hardgroove-with-the-digital-haze-ep/\">Elisa Bee returns to Hardgroove with the &#8216;Digital Haze&#8217; EP.</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Miami’s Factory Town hosted nearly 100 artists at Hocus Pocus this year, delivering a night-to-sunrise dance experience rooted in atmosphere, community, and thoughtful production.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who lives in <strong>Miami</strong> and has watched <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/hocus-pocus/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"23047\">Hocus Pocus</a></strong> evolve since its first year, I can confidently say the festival consistently outdoes itself, and the attention to detail is what stands out. The city is already a playground for dance-music enthusiasts year-round, but Halloween hits differently here. It may not be about trick-or-treating anymore, yet the festive energy remains unmistakable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hocus Pocus taps into that nostalgia in a way few festivals can, transforming <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/factory-town/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"23565\">Factory Town </a></strong>into a Halloween-themed playground with immersive décor, creative touches, and an atmosphere that feels surprisingly warm and communal, even inside a rave. It’s a night-to-sunrise party, but it also brings back the pure spirit of Halloween nights from younger days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From <strong>October 31</strong> to<strong> November 2</strong>, Factory Town became a nocturnal environment once again, running from 7pm to 7am and hosting over 90 artists across three nights. Because large events at the venue happen every few months, there’s always a sense of anticipation when the gates open. Even as a returning attendee who knows the venue well, the scale of the programming always manages to feel larger than life, and the lineups never cease to excite me and slightly surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve danced through countless Miami Music Week closings and late-night sessions here, and Hocus Pocus has always been one of the most defining and creatively assembled dance events that I urge music enthusiasts to attend. 2025 was different, not because of who played, but because of what Factory Town is becoming, and thousands came to see it for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Factory Town Hocus Pocus 2025\" class=\"wp-image-270737\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-500x334.jpg 500w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-768x512.jpg 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-750x500.jpg 750w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-Atmosphere1-CreditADINAYEV-1140x760.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo Credit: ADINAYEV</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hocus Pocus is a growing festival with a venue that is redefining itself.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Hocus Pocus is still young in the grand timeline of festivals. The venue is the kind of space that holds the energy of the factory it once was, and part of its charm is that it feels found rather than designed. Now, after renovations, the venue feels more permanent. For some, the changes brought relief. For others, a little of the venue’s wild charm felt like it was traded away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The festival unfolded inside that tension, and either way, the heart of the festival, the venue, and the community that enjoys it were there from start to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most talked-about aspects of the weekend was the sound quality. From our experience, each stage remained clear and consistent, even during peak hours, something not always guaranteed at US festivals. The Infinity Room, a risk given its size and open-air format, stood out for its powerful sound that didn&#8217;t overwhelm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Production offered a combination of lighting architecture, haze, and movement that defined the space. It was exciting as always, and offered plenty of Halloween spirit, but the focus remained on the music and the connection between the people. Additionally, the local presence felt purposeful, not token, and it was evident in the mixed lineups where big names and local risers collided, with fans showing up every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Factory Town Hocus Pocus 2025\" class=\"wp-image-270739\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-400x500.jpg 400w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-768x960.jpg 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-750x938.jpg 750w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-InfinityRoom-VintageCulture-CreditADINAYEV-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo Credit: ADINAYEV</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The festival&#8217;s stages told a story of its space.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Infinity Room</strong> is always the first reminder of just how large and open Factory Town can feel. The sound was sharp, and the stage’s scale didn’t swallow the crowd. I found myself here for sets from <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/loco-dice/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"2386\">Loco Dice</a>, Prunk</strong> b2b <strong>Kerri Chandler</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/vintage-culture/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"16944\">Vintage Culture</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/josh-baker/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"26608\">Josh Baker</a></strong>, <strong>Nicole Gallamini</strong>, <strong>Luke Dean</strong>, and a euphoric b2b from <strong>Jamie Jones</strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/seth-troxler/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"2381\">Seth Troxler</a></strong>. A moment that stayed with me was seeing <strong>Rony Seikaly</strong> again, the first DJ I ever saw when I moved to Miami. It felt like a full-circle marker of how long this city has been shaping me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This stage gave the floor to massive global acts that have gained respect across genres for their sounds and longevity in the game, for good reason, reinforcing the festival&#8217;s enormous and communal energy. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Park has a special place in my heart and in my itinerary when it comes to a night at Factory Town. </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The shape of the crowd, narrow and extended, the overhead cover that filters sound just enough to feel enclosed but not trapped, and the vantage point from VIP/backstage, where you can see the entire dance floor breathing together, are some of the reasons I find myself at this stage making the best of memories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, the stage moved through arcs shaped by giants like <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/adriatique/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"2433\">Adriatique</a></strong> and <strong>WhoMadeWho</strong>, <strong>Gioli &amp; Assia, Daizy</strong>, and <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/disclosure/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"578\">Disclosure</a></strong>, whose set left attendees raving. <a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/gordo/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"25830\"><strong>Gordo</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/sara-landry/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"19215\">Sara Landry</a></strong> each took the space into high-energy closings, while <strong>KI/KI</strong> delivered the kind of hypnotic acid-leaning build that makes the hours feel suspended. The direction in which the stage faces changes here and there, so its frequent switch-ups made its expansion this year less notable. What is key here is that the stage still offered a satisfying range across genres and moods, with the same incredible, particular intensity that makes you want to release all the energy within.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Warehouse seemed brighter inside this year, but the music still leaned dark and dense. </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A stacked lineup including <strong>Sister System</strong>, techno-pounding legend <strong>DJ Stingray 313</strong>, <strong>Hannah Laing</strong>, <strong>999999999</strong>, <strong>Cole Knight</strong>, <strong>Interplanetary Criminal</strong>, and Miami-native gems <strong>Berakka</strong> and <strong>Coffintexts</strong> shaped a room where movement felt explosive. It was the kind of space you enter to feel the music physically, not to watch a performance happen in front of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Factory Town Hocus Pocus 2025 The Chain Room\" class=\"wp-image-270875\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-500x334.jpg 500w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-ChainRoom-MahmutOrhan-CreditADINAYEV-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo Credit: ADINAYEV</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Chain Room remains the best expression of Factory Town history, to me, ridden with grungy, close, and confident vibes. </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The expansion toward the back physically opened the room, but the energy remained tight and grounded. This is the stage where appreciation feels personal rather than performative. <strong>Kitty Amor </strong>and <strong>Mahmut Orhan&#8217;s </strong>groovy indie elements offered refreshing sounds that aren&#8217;t always rinsed in the city, and the crowd absolutely appreciated them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my favorite acts, whether huge, steady, or on the rise, grace this stage for raw, authentic displays of their artistry, all while keeping things fun. <strong>SOSA</strong>, <strong>Ruze, Slugg</strong>, and <strong>Chelina Manuhutu</strong> were on the top of my list to see, and this stage housed them this year, to my delight. Sets here feel less like shows and more like conversations held at high volume between artists and fans. Every artist played their heart out regardless of changes in their stage here, and that&#8217;s all I really pay attention to when I&#8217;m on its ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"Factory Town Hocus Pocus 2025 Cypress End\" class=\"wp-image-270868\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-500x334.jpg 500w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-768x512.jpg 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-750x500.jpg 750w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FactoryTown-HocusPocus2025-CypressEnd-LiquidEarth-CreditADINAYEV-1140x760.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Photo Credit: ADINAYEV</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cypress End is where the renovation felt most debated. </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The stage expanded and the lighting increased. Some missed how it used to sit, tucked into shadow, barely visible unless you were inside it. But even with the changes, the energy held true. It remained a place where people weren’t watching the stage as much as they were feeling the crowd. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top-tier sets rang through the section from <strong>Rafael</strong> (arguably one of the standout performances of the entire festival), <strong>Bakke</strong>, who went b2b<strong> </strong>with<strong> Bort</strong>, a key curator in Miami&#8217;s local scene, with some of the city&#8217;s most impactful figures like <strong>Sinopoli</strong> and <strong>Danyelino</strong>, also paying homage to the scene on the decks this year. The stage is capable of delivering deeply personal and grounding moments, and it did not fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hocus Pocus 2025 didn’t just showcase artists, but showcased a venue in transition. </strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>People will disagree about whether Factory Town has improved or lost something, and both views are valid. But what can be assured was that the festival felt lived-in and connected, and the high-energy performances delivered gave testament to the venue&#8217;s unique charm for both the artists and fans &#8212; as it has done from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow Hocus Pocus:</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hocuspocusmiami.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website&nbsp;</a>|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100087126369234\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HocusPocusMIA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">X</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hocuspocusmiami/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/OfficialClubSpace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@clubspace_miami\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com/2025/11/12/hocus-pocus-miami-2025-review/\">Hocus Pocus: A Halloween Festival That Continues to Grow Into Its Identity</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com\">EDM Identity</a>.</p>\n",

Its brightest stars, Hamal, Sheratan, Mesarthim, and 41 Ari, mark the head, shoulders, and body of&nbsp;</em><em>the ram, while smaller stars trace the horns and outline, forming a luminous guide across the night sky. The EP&nbsp;</em><em>unfolds like a journey through sound and space. Aries Constellation brings electro and ambient textures for a&nbsp;</em><em>spatial journey, Astral Combination flows through nostalgic house rhythms, and Healing in Space draws on&nbsp;</em><em>Detroit-inspired hopeful waves with subtle acid lines. Each track moves between intensity and calm, taking the&nbsp;</em><em>listener on a journey through sound.

The result is a body of work made not for algorithms or DJ tools, but for people seeking&nbsp;<strong>energy and emotion</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I wanted to prove that drum &amp; bass can have real songs – with hooks, melodies and feeling – and still go hard,”</em> he explains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album takes listeners on a journey through Andromedik’s full spectrum: from nostalgic nods (<em>Nothing Like You</em>) to high-energy anthems (<em>Stone of Air</em>), emotional cuts (<em>Feelings</em>) and festival bangers (<em>Sunlight</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>High-profile collabs: Netsky, Kanine, Lauren L’aimant &amp; more</strong><br />​<em>Ascension</em> features collaborations with some of Andromedik’s biggest inspirations and close friends in the scene. A track with <strong>Netsky</strong> marks a personal milestone:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve said in almost every interview that he’s my biggest inspiration,” he laughs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other guests include <strong>Kanine</strong>, <strong>Lauren L’aimant</strong> – returning for the lead single <em>Only One</em> after their earlier collabs on <em>Comedown</em> and <em>Air</em> – plus <strong>Basstripper</strong> (BE) and <strong>A Little Sound</strong> (UK) on the standout tune <em>Sunlight</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With </strong><em><strong>Ascension</strong></em><strong>, Andromedik cements his place among Europe’s drum &amp; bass elite – proving once again that Belgium’s D&amp;B scene is very much alive and kicking.

Anchored by <strong>Andrew Frontini</strong>’s resonant baritone, the album spans ten musical parables set against twangy, reverb-drenched guitars, bluesy organ textures, and deep retro synth stylings from keyboardist <strong>Jon Loewen</strong>. Buttressed by <strong>Lynda Kraar</strong>’s melodic bass and <strong>Lisa Logan</strong>’s precise, orchestral drumming, <strong><em>Surface Tension</em></strong> balances haunting reverie with savage rock energy, mining the depths of a life lived in rock‘n’roll purgatory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<strong><em>Surface Tension</em></strong>&nbsp;taught us to experiment and improvise. To lean into our musical backgrounds, drawing upon a lifetime of playing and listening to music,” says&nbsp;<strong>Frontini</strong>. “It’s always intense, trying to get a lot done in a very compressed time period. The whole album was recorded, including overdubs in five days.” The album’s themes invite listeners to embrace life’s anxieties, fears, and doubts, breaking through the “surface tension” of everyday existence into greater understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Listen Now:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://ditto.fm/surface_tension\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>https://ditto.fm/surface_tension</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Surface Tension\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2jX12Yuyduq4yLn4dTX6HW?si=Fx0s3xMCRO-_HK7-a1b5iA&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the album is “<strong>Curiosity</strong>,” a dark and moody track inspired by the perils and powers of the imagination.&nbsp;<strong>Frontini&nbsp;</strong>describes it as “a cautionary tale about the dangers of curiosity – art’s catalyst that can make you crazy.” A period of daydreaming and obsessive self-reflection fueled the song, and the resulting composition captures the tension of a mind teetering between fantasy and reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recording process highlights&nbsp;<strong>Original Pairs</strong>’ commitment to organic, live-off-the-floor performance. “We never use click tracks and we don’t cut and paste,” explains&nbsp;<strong>Frontini</strong>. “We aim for a live performance with the maximum of emotional intensity that it brings. It’s never perfect but always real.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The song’s final climax features a layered interplay of guitars, Rhodes piano, Moog synth, and driving drum fills, building to a dramatic, chaotic peak that mirrors the narrative of obsession and inner turmoil. Producer<strong>&nbsp;John Dinsmore</strong>’s final mix emphasized the dramatic arc from ponderous and wistful to anxiety-fueled freak out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Surface Tension</em></strong>&nbsp;finds&nbsp;<strong>Original Pairs&nbsp;</strong>stretching into more ambitious song structures, sonic textures, and lyrical exploration than ever before. From contemplative tracks to explosive rock crescendos, the album cements the band’s reputation as purveyors of emotionally charged, unflinching rock.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/original-pairs-explore-existential-longing-and-musical-catharsis-on-new-album-surface-tension-featuring-the-brooding-focus-track-curiosity/\">Original Pairs Explore Existential Longing and Musical Catharsis on New Album ‘Surface Tension’ Featuring the Brooding Focus Track “Curiosity”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>U.S. electronic artists Randy Perez and Not Yurs have joined forces for their new single “Get Down,” out now on Direct Action Records. The track blends house and <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tag/minimal-techno/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"7448\">techno</a> with late-night energy, built for underground rooms and after-hours crowds where rhythm carries the night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Driven by tight percussion and hypnotic groove work, “Get Down” captures the collaborative chemistry between two acts making consistent moves across the U.S. scene. The song channels the pulse of club culture—direct, percussive, and focused—while giving space for both artists’ individual touch. It’s a track that builds tension through simplicity, letting sound and structure lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Randy Perez, based in Arizona, has become a familiar name at major festivals including <em>Decadence</em> and <em>Goldrush</em>, performing alongside Diplo, <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/curlyheads-whatchu-gonna-do-feat-smith-sorren-remix/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"79479\">Sidepiece</a>, and Jauz. His previous single “The Motion” earned radio support from <em>Insomniac Radio (Analog)</em>, adding to a growing catalog that shows his range as both a DJ and producer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not Yurs, a Phoenix duo, continue to rise with releases on respected labels like <em>Vivifier</em>, <em>Black Lizard</em>, and <em>Angry Dog Records</em>. Their sets blend high-tempo house and driving techno, a combination that has taken them from local club circuits to major stages in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. Known for their high-energy approach, the pair have shared stages with Green Velvet and Layton Giordani, developing a reputation for strong, adaptable performances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, Perez and Not Yurs turn “Get Down” into a statement of intent—two regional forces linking to build something built for motion. The <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tag/lineup-release/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"8534\">release</a> marks another step in both artists’ steady growth and shows how collaboration continues to shape the next wave of American club music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Get Down\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4MTOs2SoYtsWiOC519rPbw?si=f77cb45bb2df4d85&utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure><p>The post <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/randy-perez-not-yurs-get-down/\">Randy Perez & Not Yurs Drop New Single “Get Down” on Direct Action Records</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com\">Daily Beat</a>.</p>",

      "fullContent": "<p>Rising indie artist DLG. (David De La Garza) has released his debut album I Learned It the Hard Way, an 11-track collection that traces the emotional territory between self-doubt and growth. The record arrives as a focused statement from an artist finding his rhythm in a moment when independent music is more personal and wide-reaching than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built around introspective songwriting and fluid production, I Learned It the Hard Way blends reflective storytelling with forward-leaning sound design. The <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tag/discovery-project/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"10894\">project</a> moves from quiet moments of reflection to cinematic surges of energy, balancing vulnerability and control. DLG.’s delivery carries the warmth of classic soul and the looseness of modern alt-pop, drawing light comparisons to Mac Miller and the atmospheric pull of Tame Impala, yet remaining unmistakably his own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album’s tone is honest and self-aware. Each track unfolds like a page from a journal—fragments of heartbreak, discovery, and reconciliation stitched into vivid production. Songs like “Used To Be,” “Bad For Me,” and the title track show an artist comfortable in contrast: smooth vocal phrasing against textured, shifting beats. The result feels both familiar and newly built, a record that lives comfortably between bedroom intimacy and <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tiesto-5-godz-the-motto/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"73630\">festival-ready</a> polish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DLG.’s momentum has been steady. With more than 50 million streams across platforms and support from editorial playlists including New Music Friday, Lowkey, and Internet Crush, he continues to expand his reach without losing focus. The visual artwork for the album, created with his mother—a painter and sculptor—ties the project to his <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/tag/austin-millz/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"3081\">Austin</a>, Texas roots and gives the release a sense of place often missing from digital-first careers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now based in Los Angeles, DLG. represents a generation of artists shaping their identity through authenticity and craft rather than hype. I Learned It the Hard Way stands as both a debut and a declaration—a record built from real experience, positioned to last beyond the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\nhttps://open.spotify.com/album/36twGx6NXBTZz1kduel6DP?si=CjhmMrROSuCYUbFdUS2F1Q\n</div></figure><p>The post <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/dlg-i-learned-it-the-hard-way/\">DLG.

And these no-phone shows are the perfect extension of that idea  a remminder to disconnect, be present, and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"392523\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392523\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-696x870.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-1068x1335.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-1920x2400.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-336x420.jpg 336w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/27-NEO-DEBUT-NYC-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"392521\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392521\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-696x870.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-1068x1335.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-1920x2400.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-336x420.jpg 336w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21-Pic-press-Buenos-aires-2025-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" data-id=\"392522\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392522\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-1638x2048.jpg 1638w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-696x870.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-1068x1335.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-1920x2400.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-336x420.jpg 336w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/29-NEO-Ibiza-2024-scaled.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/5NIh6RvA8hOV31OnQGdk4d?si=b804f73a9ba941ed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">‘MEET ME’</a></strong> is out now on all platforms.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>After a year-long hiatus, <strong>Metrik </strong>breaks the silence with his new album &#8211; the <em>Awake </em>LP &#8211; a 12-track odyssey crafted over five years, marking his most powerful yet vulnerable project of his career to date. Where some would call this a comeback, others might argue this is a bold rebirth, one born from adversity and the pursuit of finding light in the dark. Despite his seemingly quiet year in the drum and bass public eye, <strong>Metrik’s </strong>journey into the making of this album has been far from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Metrik’s </strong>recent release ‘Hole’ with <strong>Filthy Pig</strong>, featuring <strong>Enter Shikari’s Rou Reynolds</strong>, has recently been hailed as BBC Radio 1’s Hottest Record in the World. Providing a glimpse into <em>Awake </em>LP, this track embodies the raw sentiment and fortitude that this album sets to reflect, bridging the gap between human emotion and musical perception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For <strong>Metrik</strong>, music production isn’t just about deciding on the right chord structure or drum pattern (though, this is an arduous task in itself), but it’s about creating art which “people can connect with on a deeper level”. And this album does just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From lyrical writing and performing his own vocals to creating sounds that resonate with his vision, <strong>Metrik </strong>has truly reconnected with what it means to be, well… <strong>Metrik</strong>. But this album has not been without barriers. It comes from a place where hurt, loss, and challenging times meet hope, future, and reconciliation. While testing the waters with new sounds and pushing himself vocally, he’s proved himself as a multi-talented asset in the drum and bass community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Metrik </strong>hasn’t just awoken; he is evolving. We asked <strong>Metrik </strong>back into the studio for a chat about the story behind his <em>Awake </em>LP, and to find out more about the experiences that shaped this album since the launch of <em>Ex Machina</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Metrik - Setting Sun\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0rWdsV625dk?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How are you feeling about your upcoming Awake LP release?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve got a lot of feelings tied to this project, but mainly I’m proud. Stepping away, and my reasons for that, shaped this album in a big way. Coming back meant rebuilding my relationship with music and with myself, which wasn’t easy. But now it feels like I’m returning with something honest and lived-in. It feels good to reconnect with the drum and bass community, with my fans, and to get back to doing what I love the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>During your time away, was there anything you learnt about yourself either as a music producer or on a personal level?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, the break definitely helped me gain perspective. Trying to balance family, making music, touring and ADHD eventually led to intense burnout. I’ve learned to manage my time a bit better and ask for help rather than silently carrying on. Musically, I’ve grown too. <em>Ex Machina </em>was the first time I used my own voice, but it was masked in layers of grandiose, sci-fi aesthetic. With <em>Awake</em>, I wanted to be more direct and write from real personal experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Absolutely! It’s always good to stay true to yourself as an artist.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. To take the experiences in my life, convert them into songs and then sing them with conviction felt daunting initially. But I’ve learned that when it comes to art, the ideas that feel a bit scary are usually the ones worth exploring. I’ve tapped into so much creative potential this way and it’s never felt better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It must be difficult managing family life with your career in music. Do these challenges reflect the meaning behind Awake?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely. A lot of these songs started out as real conversations. I was juggling a lot in my life at the time and I was trying to make sense of it all, so the writing sessions often turned into these honest, sometimes heavy discussions about who I was, who I’d been, and who I was trying to become. Those conversations naturally shaped the lyrics and the sound. That’s really where the title comes from. <em>Awake </em>represents that moment of recognising what actually matters and learning to speak from my own voice again. For years, I think I was chasing something quite surface-level, like trying to live up to an idea of what I thought I should be. This album comes from a more grounded place. It feels like me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This album really feels like a journey of self-discovery. How has this resonated with your fan base so far?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been really moving. When I started opening up about what I’d been going through, I got messages from people dealing with similar things. Even though some themes are heavy, the album isn’t bleak. There’s release and clarity in it. Seeing people find their own meaning in these songs has been incredibly rewarding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve publicly mentioned your personal challenges while writing this album. Was there something in particular that helped you overcome these challenges in order to finalise this project?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stepping back was huge. I needed space to look after my mental health and get perspective. It reminded me that if I disappear from socials for a month, the world won’t end. I realised how much pressure I was putting on myself. Being an artist isn’t just making music, it’s constantly presenting yourself too, and with attention deficit, time blindness, and overwhelm in the mix, staying consistent can be tough. I had to stop fighting that and accept my limitations. The album came from a darker period, so I couldn’t finish it until I was in a better place. Once I got there, the music flowed with much more clarity and energy, which is also why we ended up with more singles than originally planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Metrik - Hole (ft.

How did this collaboration with Filthy Pig and Rou Reynolds come about?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Filthy Pig </strong>&#8211; Nick &#8211; is an incredible songwriter and producer. He’s a master of alternative pop and rock, and he brings that into drum and bass in such a natural way. The early version of ‘Hole’ had this introspective verse from me, a metaphor for what I was going through at the time, but we knew it needed another voice for the vision to fully come together. Rou was the obvious choice. He has this rare ability to be powerful, direct and articulate all at once. I’ve been a huge <strong>Enter Shikari </strong>fan for years, and I’ve always been inspired by how fearless and expressive they are. We’d spoken a bit online and I’d done a remix for them, so there was already a mutual respect there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It sounds like your existing relationship helped your collaboration to flow naturally…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, completely. It clicked straight away. I was on holiday, sitting on a sun lounger with my headphones on, and Rou sent me his first vocal idea as a WhatsApp voice note. I remember swearing out loud in front of a group of kids because it was <em>that </em>good. Working on this with Rou and Nick has been a real pleasure. ‘Hole’ is a very personal track for me, so to see it resonate like this has meant a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In your eyes, which track from the album has been getting the biggest reaction from crowds at shows?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Synchronize’. I’ve had people singing the lead melody back to me even though it’s not released yet, which hasn’t happened before. It also ties together the core themes of <em>Awake, </em>which is why it’s the album’s focus track. It’s specifically about ADHD &#8211; the chaos, the overload, and the yearning to feel “normal” (whatever that means). But the lyrics are open enough that people can bring their own meaning to it, and hopefully enjoy it as a big, uplifting moment… even if you take me and my existential dread out of the equation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did you decide which tracks made the cut for the album?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pool was smaller this time, which actually helped. I had a clear instinct with what belonged in the <em>Awake </em>universe and put all my energy into those tracks. The selection process had a pretty strict criteria: did it belong in the <em>Awake </em>universe? Sonically, that meant it needed a heavy, industrial core with moments of euphoria. That was the benchmark for consistency. The only odd one out is ‘Waves’, which is much more uplifting, but that track is special for me and Josh (<strong>Grafix</strong>). We wrote it overlooking the south coast in the middle of winter, completely immersed in the landscape and atmosphere, so it felt essential to include. And then there’s a track called ‘Burnout’ which didn’t make the final cut because, fittingly, I ran out of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are there different inspirations behind both your lyrical writing and music production?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. The lyrics are where I’m processing real things from my life &#8211; ADHD, identity, grief, trying to reconnect with myself. It’s very personal and internal. The production is where the <em>world </em>around those feelings gets built. That’s where the cyberpunk and industrial influences come in. It’s the atmosphere, the architecture, the sense of scale. I’ve always been drawn to creating music that feels like it lives inside its own universe rather than just being a track. So the lyrics are the human core, and the production is the environment those emotions live in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It’s really interesting to see how you’re merging your storytelling with creating an immersive world within your music…</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. The immersive side comes from the fact I think visually when I write. It’s almost like scoring a film scene that doesn’t exist yet. That’s how the <em>Awake Industries </em>universe took shape. The AV show, the artwork and the design language all stem from the idea of a post-human, cyberpunk tech cult. Visually, I build it the same way I produce: start with a loose concept, then develop it through animation, 3D, typography, and AI workflows. So when you’re at the show, holding the vinyl or seeing a clip online, you’re entering the world it belongs to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve explained a lot about the sound of the album. How do you reckon this sound will develop in your future music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This album came from a very specific headspace. Someone said to me recently, “the vibe is darker than your older stuff &#8211; are we going to hear something more uplifting soon?” and I totally get where that comes from. When I started writing <em>Awake</em>, a lot of music around me felt very safe and comforting, which made sense after Covid, but I just wasn’t in that place at all. I couldn’t force myself to make something bright or “nice” even if I tried. But I don’t hear the album as bleak. It’s heavy, yeah &#8211; but there’s release and energy in there too, the same way rock and metal can hit hard emotionally but still lift you up. Vocally and lyrically, this is the most open I’ve ever been, and the way people have responded has</p>\n\n\n\n<p>given me a lot of confidence to keep pushing that side of what I do. I’m already writing again and it feels exciting &#8211; same honesty and intensity, but with more space and new colours.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Metrik - Disconnection (Album Preview)\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvGHzC57VIk?list=PLT77EQ4tSMDW1dF1JtpNbUQszumIg-4xg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So, what does this mean for your shows?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AV show is where the world-building really expands.

Perhaps… probably means I’ll do it anyway though!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That sounds really exciting! Let’s now open up the table…is there anything else you want to share about the album?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a big thank you, honestly. I really appreciate everyone’s patience and support throughout this period. It’s taken a lot to get here, but I’m in a good place creatively again and genuinely excited for what’s coming next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>Carrillo Music Group closed Amsterdam Dance Event 2025 with three milestone gatherings that threaded together history, collaboration, and community. What began as a familiar week of showcases grew into something larger — a reminder of how house music’s roots and future continue to meet in the same rooms, under the same pulse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The label’s programming this year stretched across multiple venues in Amsterdam. Each event focused on a different corner of Carrillo’s story: the tenth anniversary of <em>Women of House</em>, the twenty-ninth year of <em>Welcome To The Club</em>, and an official <em>Women of House ADE Showcase</em> that tied everything together. The three moments captured a single idea — that the connections built in nightlife can evolve into lifelong creative bonds.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women of House – Free Love Edition (10-Year Anniversary)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 25, 2025 – Spuistraat 109, Amsterdam | 6:00 PM–10:00 PM</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"460\" height=\"576\" data-attachment-id=\"80873\" data-permalink=\"https://daily-beat.com/carrillo-music-group-reflects-on-connection-and-legacy-after-ade-2025/screenshot-2025-11-12-122919-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122919-1.png?fit=460%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"460,576\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2025-11-12 122919\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122919-1.png?fit=460%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122919-1.png?fit=460%2C576&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122919-1.png?resize=460%2C576&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-80873\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Women of House – Free Love Edition</em> anniversary was both celebration and reflection. The collective began ten years ago as a small circle of DJs and producers sharing space in a male-dominated scene. A decade later, it has become an international network that links artists from Chicago to Seoul.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The night’s lineup mirrored that growth. Sets from First Lady, Better, Nita Funk, Isa Carrillo, and others moved fluidly through styles — soulful house, rhythm-driven funk, and percussive blends that kept the room grounded. Between songs, short pauses allowed for words of thanks and recognition. “Ten years of Women of House shows how much can happen when women support each other,” Isa Carrillo said from the booth. “It’s always been about the music, but also about the space we make for each other.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event carried warmth more than spectacle. Lights stayed soft, the floor stayed full, and the sense of shared history gave the room its gravity. What began as an advocacy effort now feels like an institution, quietly rewriting what representation in house culture can look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Welcome To The Club – 29th Anniversary Edition</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 25, 2025 – NDSM-Kade 2, Amsterdam | 11:00 PM–4:00 AM</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"462\" height=\"582\" data-attachment-id=\"80872\" data-permalink=\"https://daily-beat.com/carrillo-music-group-reflects-on-connection-and-legacy-after-ade-2025/screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-1.png?fit=462%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"462,582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2025-11-12 122858\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-1.png?fit=462%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-1.png?fit=462%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-1.png?resize=462%2C582&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-80872\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Later that evening, attention shifted north to NDSM-Kade 2 for <em>Welcome To The Club’s</em> 29th anniversary. The night had the energy of a reunion — the kind where faces change but the rhythm stays constant. Presented by DJ Max, the event featured DJ Izee, Kardano, Ron Carroll, Isa Carrillo, and Soleil Carrillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the 1990s, <em>Welcome To The Club</em> has operated as both event and community, shaping a loyal following around straightforward values: good sound, real crowds, and no shortcuts. The 2025 edition stayed true to that legacy. The set transitions were seamless, the crowd responsive, the mood grounded in nostalgia without tipping into retro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Welcome To The Club has always been about connection,” DJ Max said afterward. “It’s a room where the old guard and the new guard meet halfway. That’s why people keep coming back.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The night was less about marking time and more about continuity — proof that house music’s endurance depends not on trends, but on places that hold their identity through change. Carrillo Music Group’s consistent presence behind the brand reinforces that approach: longevity through authenticity, growth through relationships.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Women of House – Official ADE Showcase</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 25, 2025 – Amsterdam | 1:00 PM–5:00 PM</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"462\" height=\"582\" data-attachment-id=\"80874\" data-permalink=\"https://daily-beat.com/carrillo-music-group-reflects-on-connection-and-legacy-after-ade-2025/screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-2.png?fit=462%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"462,582\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Screenshot 2025-11-12 122858\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-2.png?fit=462%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-2.png?fit=462%2C582&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/daily-beat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-12-122858-2.png?resize=462%2C582&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-80874\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in the day, the <em>Women of House Official ADE Showcase</em> offered a different rhythm. Staged as a daytime session, it mixed live sets with open discussions and mentorship conversations. The lineup included DJ Emma, DJ Val, Better, Nita Funk, Mia Banks, DJ Justine, and Isa Carrillo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where the anniversary party celebrated history, the showcase looked ahead. The focus was on discovery — new sounds, younger artists, and the exchange of ideas between generations. The room felt more like a workshop than a club, with attendees moving easily between performances and dialogue. Soleil Carrillo described it as “a bridge between artists and opportunity — a place where the next generation can find footing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format reinforced what <em>Women of House</em> has quietly achieved over ten years: turning representation into infrastructure. Through events, mentorship, and visibility, it has built one of electronic music’s most active global networks for female and non-binary talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Threads of Community</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken together, the three events told a larger story about how Carrillo Music Group operates. The label doesn’t treat its gatherings as isolated moments. Each one connects to the next, forming a loop between mentorship, performance, and heritage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At ADE 2025, that loop was on full display. Artists from the U.S., Europe, and Asia shared lineups that blended cultural identity with common rhythm. Longtime contributors like Ron Carroll played alongside first-time ADE performers. Veteran DJs shared time with younger peers in casual conversation before and after sets. It was collaboration as everyday practice, not concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrillo’s approach to event programming mirrors its larger philosophy: build spaces where artists can develop without losing individuality. The label’s focus on diversity and access isn’t framed as branding; it’s built into the day-to-day reality of who they book and how they run their stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>After the Music</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As the week closed, the tone among performers and guests was one of quiet satisfaction rather than spectacle. The 10-year mark for <em>Women of House</em> and the 29-year run of <em>Welcome To The Club</em> felt less like endpoints and more like reminders of what endurance looks like in a constantly shifting industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>House music has always been about repetition — about the same rhythm taking new shape through time. Carrillo Music Group’s ADE presence proved that repetition doesn’t mean stagnation. When built on connection and shared purpose, it becomes a living rhythm that renews itself with each beat, each face, each night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, ADE 2025 wasn’t defined by scale or production value, but by tone. The energy across Carrillo’s events came from the same place that has fueled house for decades: people gathering to share sound and presence. As DJ Max put it, “The goal is simple — keep it alive, keep it real, and keep it moving.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrillo Music Group’s role in Amsterdam this year reflected that simplicity. Its events were rooted in community, shaped by collaboration, and carried by the steady pulse of artists who believe in music as connection. With another ADE behind them, the label leaves Amsterdam not just with memories, but with renewed proof that the culture still grows best in spaces built on trust, respect, and rhythm.</p><p>The post <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com/carrillo-music-group-reflects-on-connection-and-legacy-after-ade-2025/\">Carrillo Music Group Reflects on Connection and Legacy After ADE 2025</a> first appeared on <a href=\"https://daily-beat.com\">Daily Beat</a>.</p>",

The Freerider Pro keeps the logistics simple so the day stays stress-free. Fast-access avalanche tool storage reduces digging around when you need to practice transitions. The rear U-zip opening gives you the whole main compartment at once, which makes packing quick in the morning and unpacking painless when you get home. Less friction outside usually means more energy when you sit back down to produce or write.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carry and fit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Freerider Pro 32+10 weighs 2.43 lb with a 32 L capacity that expands by 10 L using the roll-top. Back length is listed at 15 to 21 in with a recommended load of 13 to 22 lb. The women’s 30+10 SL comes in at 2.38 lb, 30 L plus 10 L expansion, a 15 to 19 in back length, and the same load range. Both use a flexible Delrin U-frame, padded shoulder straps, stabilizer straps, and ergonomic hip fins, which keeps the pack close so it skis cleanly and stays comfortable during longer hikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Carry options and access</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"878\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-30-878x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82306\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-30-878x1024.png 878w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-30-257x300.png 257w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-30-768x896.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-30.png 1200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 878px) 100vw, 878px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Side or diagonal ski carry, front snowboard or snowshoe carry, dual ice-axe loops, and a rope strap cover most winter setups. The rear opening with a U-shaped zipper keeps the snow-facing panel clean, and the top-loader zip helps with fast grabs. Hydration is supported up to 3 L. You also get hip-belt pockets, a fleece-lined goggle pocket, and a wet compartment to keep damp layers separate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A detachable mesh helmet holder keeps the lid in place on the climb. The sternum strap buckle can be operated with one hand and includes a safety whistle. The back panel fabric sheds snow to cut down on ice build-up, and there is an SOS label for quick reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Specs at a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>• Freerider Pro 32+10: 2.43 lb, 32 L + 10 L, 23 x 13 x 7.1 in, load 13–22 lb, back length 15–21 in, body height 62–77 in<br>• Freerider Pro 30+10 SL: 2.38 lb, 30 L + 10 L, 21 x 13 x 7.9 in, load 13–22 lb, back length 15–19 in, body height 62–70 in<br>• Price: $195</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use snow days to reset your ears and return with better ideas, this pack covers the practical side.

With a redesigned interface, optimized load times, and a massive sound library, ZENOLOGY GX provides producers and composers with an expansive platform for creative sound design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZENOLOGY GX delivers access to more than 11,000 meticulously designed Roland sounds spanning genres from vintage analog tones to modern electronic textures. Users can layer up to four independent sound engines per Scene, each equipped with its own effects, arpeggiator, and chord generator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new macro system introduces 16 LFO-automatable controls for expressive real-time manipulation, giving users hands-on control over evolving tones and performance dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Platform for Deep Sound Design</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Moody-Monday-MOD-1024x594.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82287\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Moody-Monday-MOD-1024x594.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Moody-Monday-MOD-300x174.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Moody-Monday-MOD-768x446.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Moody-Monday-MOD-1536x892.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Moody-Monday-MOD-2048x1189.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For sound designers, ZENOLOGY GX is built for depth and flexibility. It includes 23 oscillator and filter models, over 7,000 PCM waveforms, and 11 LFO shapes, including a Step LFO offering 37 distinct curves per step. Each layer supports its own multi-effects section, featuring more than 90 professional-grade effects such as the JUNO-106 chorus, Dimension D, DJ-FX Looper, and high-end reverbs derived from Roland’s most iconic processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interface has been rebuilt from the ground up for speed and ease of use. Its modern visual layout allows quick sound browsing, layering, and editing without interrupting the creative flow. Users can create entirely new patches or modify existing ones, then export them to ZENOLOGY Pro and compatible ZEN-Core hardware instruments like the FANTOM, JUPITER-X, JUNO-X, RD-88, MC-707, and MC-101 for a seamless hybrid workflow between software and hardware environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Bridge Between Hardware and Software</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Off-Script-LFO-1024x594.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82289\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Off-Script-LFO-1024x594.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Off-Script-LFO-300x174.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Off-Script-LFO-768x446.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Off-Script-LFO-1536x892.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ZENOLOGY-GX-Off-Script-LFO-2048x1189.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ZENOLOGY GX continues Roland’s long-term effort to merge the strengths of its hardware instruments with the adaptability of in-the-box production. Integrated directly into GALAXIAS version 1.8 or later, it provides a single, cohesive platform for sound creation, performance, and management across the entire ZEN-Core ecosystem.

It’s a slick bit of kit that can connect to your computer, Wi-Fi or USB stick, and supports StreamingDirectPlay with Apple Music, Beatport Streaming, and TIDAL.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Been looking to start your DJ career, or get back into it after taking some years off?

If you don’t already have Zebra on your machine, we highly recommend grabbing a free demo download <a href=\"https://u-he.com/products/zebra-legacy/\">here</a> at u-he’s site to get a feel for this one-of-a-kind synthesizer.

It’s a deep dive, but it will be worth it! We’ll use Zebra’s XY pads to modulate numerous parameters at a time, from filter settings to effects, allowing us to effectively build multiple patches in one, and giving us the power to easily morph from one to the next to suit the needs of our track.<br><br>Though this tutorial is specific to <a href=\"https://u-he.com/products/zebra-legacy/\">Zebra</a>, there are other synths that come equipped with XY pads and allow for similar programming. Ableton Live itself slaps a programmable XY pad on any VST instrument track you create, so these concepts can really be applied to any virtual instrument if you get creative.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fire up a new session at 128 BPM, create a new instrument track hosting Zebra, loop the simple MIDI sequence below, and you’ll be ready to dive in.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":137294,\"sizeSlug\":\"large-outset\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large-outset\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.attackmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MIDI.jpg?fit=1280%2C438&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-137294\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-step-1-setting-the-foundation\">Step 1 - Setting the Foundation</h4>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First things first, initialize the patch by selecting <em>init</em> from the preset browser.

First, hit the <em>Reset</em> button on the oscillator which forces the oscillator to start from the same phase position every time a note is hit, which is key for bass patches if you want each note to hit exactly the same. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Then click on the <em>OSC FX</em> tab of the oscillator module, assign one of the knobs to the <em>Sync Mojo</em> effect, and turn the knob up to a value of about 32.

Even better, suddenly bypassing both effects on the downbeat of the drop gives you instant impact.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>We have filter automation in place, so now let’s add reverb. In the effects grid, add an instance of <em>NuRev</em> further up the signal chain from the compressor and EQ we created earlier.
