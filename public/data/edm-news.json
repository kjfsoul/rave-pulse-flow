The track is an immediate festival weapon, marking a powerful evolution for both producers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Feeling’ sees Gryffin boldly dive deeper into the <strong>emotional bass realm</strong>, perfectly fusing his signature progressive roots with YDG’s known <strong>hard-hitting edge</strong>. The result is a sonic rush built on expansive, melodic builds that explode into thunderous, transcendent drops—a track that embodies the rush of the dancefloor and showcases a compelling new dimension to Gryffin’s ever-evolving sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-full-circle-collaboration\"><strong>A Full Circle Collaboration</strong></h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"812\" height=\"968\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392987\" style=\"width:600px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM.png 812w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM-252x300.png 252w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM-768x916.png 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM-696x830.png 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-17-at-6.22.35-PM-352x420.png 352w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This collaboration is a true &#8220;full circle&#8221; moment for Gryffin as a tastemaker in the scene. The partnership began last year when he first dropped YDG&#8217;s massive remix of his track &#8216;You &amp; Me&#8217; during his explosive set at Coachella’s Do LaB. Since then, YDG has become a set staple, leading to this official joint effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Gryffin explains the synergy: &#8220;The highlight of my 2024 Coachella DoLab set was YDG’s remix of ‘You &amp; Me’. After that show, it ended up in nearly every set of mine for the rest of the year. Mikeey’s music&#8230; has managed to break through all the noise&#8230; and it was a no-brainer to work on something together. ‘The Feeling’ is one of those collaborations that fusing our sounds feels almost effortless and that’s always the right sign.&#8221;</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>YDG echoed the sentiment: “Getting the chance to collaborate with GRYFFIN was such a cool experience and our sounds worked perfectly together here. I’m so happy with the way ‘The Feeling’ came out!”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The track joins a remarkable year of releases for Gryffin, who has already delivered collaborations with titans like <strong>Kaskade</strong>, <strong>Excision</strong>, and <strong>GRiZ</strong>, solidifying his status as one of dance music’s most versatile and sought-after collaborators.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-ydg-s-rise-and-upcoming-dates\"><strong>YDG’s Rise and Upcoming Dates</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>YDG is currently one of bass music’s most exciting forces, known for viral remixes tapped by Marshmello, John Summit, and Sub Focus.

This year featured clean citywide branding, multiple badge tiers, and professional production across all venues. The only real challenge was distance. ADE Lab — home to the DJ, production, and music-tech ecosystem — was nearly a $50 Uber ride from the Felix Meritis area, where most industry panels took place. The hefty Uber price was probably directly driven up by the crappy weather, so I&#8217;m not sure what it would have cost if things were sunny and less rainy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re attending ADE for the first time, planning your route is essential. Amsterdam is compact, but ADE sprawls across it.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4472-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82488\" style=\"width:336px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4472-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4472-225x300.jpg 225w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4472-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4472.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"art-installations-fomo-and-weather-challenges\"><strong>Art Installations, FOMO, and Weather Challenges</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate the acronym FOMO, but fear of missing out is a tough reality at ADE these days. When you look at all the panels, parties, workshops, mixers, and meet-ups, it is easy to get overwhelmed and suffer a little analysis paralysis. Eventually, I found my groove, but next time I will do more planning ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ADE Lab featured great exhibitors such as Technics, Union Audio, Arturia, AiAiAi, and many more. The gear section was a bit tight, so it was all about getting there early when the crowds were lighter. I checked out a few of the art concepts, but the rain kind of deterred me from really digging in. The featured outdoor art installations probably would have been engaged more on a sunny day. Instead, the constant rain kept most people indoors. Still, the integration of art added texture to the Lab experience and helped tie music, visuals, and creativity together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4460-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82491\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4460-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4460-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4460-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4460-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4460.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">The Lab Gear Hall at ADE 2025</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4480-1-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82492\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4480-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4480-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4480-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4480-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4480-1.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"tech-innovation-l-acoustics-spatial-audio-demo\"><strong>Tech Innovation: L-Acoustics Spatial Audio Demo</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the highlights of ADE 2025 for me was the L-Acoustics panel and spatial-audio demonstration. The company showcased new DJ software that allows performers to move elements of a track in real time through a 3D sound environment. The panel included artists, club owners, and early-adopting DJs, ending with a performance by Joachim Garraud in a purpose-built demo room. It is always exciting to hear about a new technology that has the potential to change the nightlife/club experience, and then have that demonstrated live right after the panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>“Hearing a DJ set swirl around the room in real time felt like the beginning of a new era for performance.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It was easily one of the most innovative sessions of the week, and I made sure to attend. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4485-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82486\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4485-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4485-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4485-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4485-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4485.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Jeff Mills Live at ADE 2025</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"jeff-mills-redefines-live-performance-at-ade-2025\"><strong>Jeff Mills Redefines Live Performance at ADE 2025</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Going out late and keeping a healthy daytime meeting schedule is a significant challenge, but surprisingly most people stick the landing and don&#8217;t flake on meetings. We did get lucky enough to catch a few shows and made sure to line up early for Jeff Mills doing his thing live. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The legendary DJ Producer delivered a standout performance with a live performance alongside a jazz trio — piano, bass, and flute — while improvising on a 909. It was a futuristic, improvised set that reminded everyone why Mills remains one of techno&#8217;s most important innovators. It was also nice to see electronic music performed in a format that was not all about the DJ, it was artist-driven, it was spontaneous, and the entire audience was glued to every beat that was firing from that OG Roland 909. No one can work a vintage drum machine like Jeff Mills.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4445-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82493\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4445-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4445-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4445-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4445-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4445.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">UK Downtempo Duo Bent dropping a DJ set on Tuesday night before ADE</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"nightlife-arrive-early-or-miss-out\"><strong>Nightlife: Arrive Early or Miss Out</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ADE Pro badge comes with a healthy amount of free access to nightlife events and showcases. The ADE 2025 nightlife lineups remain world-class, but capacity issues were a theme. Even official events accepting ADE Pro badges closed free Pro badge access early and flipped to paid tickets. If you want to get into key parties, you need to arrive well before the posted time, or they won&#8217;t honor the badge. We missed several events because the venues cut off entry, or simply were sold out. So plan ahead, don&#8217;t be like us and end up in some dumpy bar drinking pints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a positive note, we did manage to catch an intimate set from <strong>Bent</strong>, the UK duo known for late-90s/early-2000s chill-out classics — a small but memorable highlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"travel-logistics-tips\"><strong>Travel &amp; Logistics Tips</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that ADE 2025 is a wrap, it&#8217;s important to pass along some tips for next year. Planning travel the right way is one of the biggest determinants of whether you have a smooth ADE experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Book Flights Early </strong>&#8211; October is packed in Amsterdam. Flights rise sharply as ADE approaches, so book early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choose Your Hotel Location Wisely &#8211; </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different roles require different bases of operation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>DJs and producers</strong> should stay closer to <strong>ADE Lab</strong> for easy access to activations and workshops.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Industry professionals</strong> should stay near <strong>Felix Meritis</strong> to walk between key talks and meetings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anyone doing both</strong> should choose a midpoint.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at <strong>Hotel Arena</strong>, which offered a great mix of comfort, location, and access. It has a solid restaurant, reasonable rates, and its own event space — highly recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Leverage Amsterdam&#8217;s Tram System</strong> &#8211; The tram network is fast, affordable, and far more reliable than Ubers during ADE. If your hotel is near a tram stop, your whole week becomes easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arrive a Day Early</strong> &#8211; Give yourself a day before ADE begins to settle in, explore, and enjoy Amsterdam. The city deserves attention beyond the conference itself, and you&#8217;ll appreciate catching the magic before the week becomes a sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><strong>“The magic of the city shows up when you&#8217;re not sprinting from meeting to meeting.”</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"logistical-realities\"><strong>Logistical Realities</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ADE 2025 was the biggest ADE ever, and it felt like it was strained in some ways but well done for an event this large. Badge pickup was simple and well-organized. Public transport was reliable, but sometimes very crowded due to the weather. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main issue was the physical and, at times, financial strain of traveling between rain-soaked venues, especially when meetings were scattered across the map. ADE&#8217;s sheer size begins to dilute the experience&#8217;s density. A more compact layout or reducing redundant programming could help streamline future years. I planned on sticking to certain areas of ADE on certain days, but sometimes it was impossible, and I found myself hopping around due to schedules always changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"top-10-tips-for-surviving-ade\"><strong>“Top 10 Tips for Surviving ADE” </strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4495-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82487\" style=\"width:274px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4495-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4495-225x300.jpg 225w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4495-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4495.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">EZQuest Ultraslim 70W &#8211; Pick up a good charger like this one, and a good power adapter with built-in USB cables.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>The Belgian Competition Authority (BCA) has launched an investigation into <strong>Live Nation Entertainment’s</strong> acquisition of <strong>Pukkelpop</strong>, one of the largest music festivals in Belgium. The probe was directed by the Minister for Economic Affairs and announced on November 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Live Nation, a global leader in live entertainment, <a href=\"https://www.pukkelpop.be/en/news/pukkelpop-and-live-nation-confirm-continuation-of-long-standing-collaboration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">completed the deal last month</a>, extending its &#8220;<em>collaboration of more than 40 years</em>&#8221; with Pukkelpop. Under the terms, Live Nation becomes the ultimate parent company, though Pukkelpop will remain under the leadership of founder and CEO <strong>Chokri Mahassine</strong> and his co-founders. Pukkelpop is a major annual event near Hasselt, Flanders, attracting 250,000 visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-investigation\">The Investigation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The BCA will assess how the takeover affects competition in festival organization and the broader live entertainment sector. The regulator noted that Live Nation is already active across the entire value chain in Belgium, providing artist booking services, operating major venues (like AFAS Dome and Forest National), and managing ticket sales via <strong>Ticketmaster</strong>. Live Nation also organizes three other major Belgian festivals: <strong>Rock Werchter, Dour, and Graspop</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The investigation is being conducted independently and relies on rules that prohibit anti-competitive agreements and abuses of dominant market positions under Belgian and European Union law. The BCA emphasized that opening the probe does not guarantee a specific outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite regulatory challenges, Live Nation&#8217;s financials remain robust. The concert giant reported strong <strong>Q3 2025 results</strong>, with revenue climbing 11% year-over-year to <strong>$8.5 billion</strong>. On their earnings call, Live Nation President and CFO Joe Berchtold stated that future shows and festivals are selling &#8220;as fast as ever,&#8221; indicating strong consumer demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[H/T] <a href=\"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/live-nation-acquired-one-of-belgiums-largest-music-festivals-pukkelpop-now-the-markets-competition-watchdog-is-investigating-the-deal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Music Business Worldwide</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/live-nation-pukkelpop-investigation/\">Live Nation Acquires Pukkelpop, Belgium To Launch Anti-Trust Investigation</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

And when we found out about one of the most beautiful Trance releases of the year, Paul Skelton, Andy Newtz and Tara Green&#8217;s &#8216;<strong>Angel</strong>&#8216;, we decided to go hands-on about it.

Well, we sat down with the former to catch up on it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DJ, Vocalist and Producer from Perth, Mike has grown to develop a rather strong bond with Electronic music. Once a fan and a devoted listener, now he contributes to the rich history of Dance music with his own creations. Made famous for his endless sets on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@michaelalan89/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube channel</a>, things have escalated steadily for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Angel (Michael Alan Remix)\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/43QIwthufOfmrimCiIODRN?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that he landed this impeccable old-school sounding remix for &#8216;Angel&#8217;, it was the absolute right time to speak with him about the release, his career, and his vision as a fellow artist. So, without further to do, here&#8217;s our sincere, warm little chat <strong>with the one and only Michael Alan</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-interview\">The Interview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Congratulations on the release of your remixes for ‘Angel’! To begin with, we’d love to know, how do you like the original version? What does it make you feel?<br></strong><br>Thank you so much! To put it simply, the original is such a banger. It’s overflowing with the uplifting Trance vibes that I grew up listening to, and Paul’s piano work &#8211; as a classical pianist myself &#8211; is something I’ve always been really attracted to. There’s no doubt the original has all of the important hallmarks of what I love about dance music: deep, driving, melodic, emotional, uplifting Trance! That should be enough for any man or woman!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia.jpg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393050\" style=\"width:644px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Talk us through your remixing process for the track. How did you come to work on it? Were there any challenges while flipping the track to your style?<br></strong><br>Big shout out to Marcel @ Amon Vision for hooking us up with this one! My sound is really heavily influenced by early 2000s Trance, House and progressive. I also love film score, so you’ll usually see at least some thick Hans Zimmer-like strings in my breakdowns. Because so many of those classic Trance elements were already kind of there, I found it a relatively easy flip &#8211; definitely a lot of fun to remix!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I guess it’s a surprise to no one that we’re constantly being bombarded with oceans of <em>meh</em> music released at all times. What would you say makes your remix of ‘Angel’ special, how does it stand out?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m really trying to hone in on a focused sound at the moment. To consistently produce music that has a recognizable trademark. I love a really clean, focused mix that should sound sweet on the ear, without anything harsh or fatiguing. To give an example, I think tracks like ATB &#8211; &#8216;Till I Come&#8217; are basically timeless, because they bounce like house and emote like only Trance can!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you had the chance to test your remix while DJing? If so, how’s the audience reaction been?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t yet! We’re just coming out of quite a long, cold winter here in Perth &#8211; so, while the shows are booked &#8211; road testing it is a few weeks away!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s one track, either yours or not, that you’d say changed your life in a way? If you’ve got a song with a strong personal story linked to it, for example.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignright is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Clear Blue Water - Ferry Corsten Remix\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3MbmDUxmBjLU6ZHC4FFuWE?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, there are so many. Always hard to pick one. But one that always stands out is Ferry Corsten’s remix of OceanLab &#8211; Clear Blue Water. Back in 2012, my old production partner Joe and I were playing to a sold-out Villa crowd for Amon Vision’s Trance Anthems night, wall-to-wall people in white, pure energy in the air. I’d planned to play the Mike Shiver remix, but Joe stopped me mid-reach and said, “Trust me. Play the Ferry mix.” I’d never even heard it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment I dropped it in blind… everything stopped. Seven minutes of absolute euphoria &#8211; like DJing to the crowd AND being in the crowd all at once. That experience, that feeling of being completely swept away by the music you’re sharing &amp; simultaneously learning &#8211; it’s something I’ve spent my whole life trying to recreate since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We still call Ferry “The Lord” to this day haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is Trance such a special genre of music to listen to? What would you say is the core characteristic of the genre?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels to me like unfiltered emotion &#8211; like it’s specifically designed to make people feel something more deeply than what&#8217;s at the surface. That in itself is a uniquely human experience &#8211; which I think especially today &#8211; is possibly the most important thing we can place a premium on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could go back in time, say 10 years or any number of years you’d find interesting, and meet your past self, what would you tell that younger you? Were you worrying about something that wasn’t really necessary?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d just pass on all my production techniques &amp; knowledge! I wouldn’t change anything else &#8211; and I reckon younger me would be pretty happy with a few level ups 🙂</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393049\" style=\"width:319px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-696x1043.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-1068x1601.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-280x420.jpg 280w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you see yourself in a few years’ time? How do you want people to know/remember you by?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to keep making honest music and enjoying the process! Outside of the studio, I’m at my absolute happiest and complete when I’m playing live &#8211; sharing the music and expressing/performing what the music means to me. There’s nothing better than that!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\">Final Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What a legend. Loved hearing from Mike, and what he had to say about the scene, as well as the remix itself. Gosh, I got remembered of that Ferry remix of &#8216;Clear Blue Water&#8217;, such a powerful tune. As is his remix of &#8216;Angel&#8217;! Elegant Progressive Trance reminiscent of yesteryear, it&#8217;s a jewel if you dare play it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for this interview, and thanks to Marcel from Amon Vision for linking us as well! The label is consistently putting out bangers, if you haven&#8217;t yet, you must give it a listen: they don&#8217;t miss.

The <strong>NDSM Docklands</strong> will once again become the beating heart of electronic music as DGTL celebrates its 14th edition from April 3-5, 2026. This iconic industrial site transforms into a futuristic playground where cutting-edge music collides with immersive art, all while pushing the boundaries of sustainability and community. The festival has just dropped its first wave of artist announcements, and it&#8217;s a mouth-watering mix of international heavyweights, innovative live acts, and the rising stars who are shaping tomorrow&#8217;s sound.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When Saturday April 4th rolls around, expect the energy levels to hit the ceiling. British duo<strong> Camelphat</strong> will be serving up their signature blend of progressive house and melodic techno—those euphoric build-ups and emotional crescendos that make dance floors come alive. Meanwhile, Manchester&#8217;s <strong>Interplanetary Criminal</strong> injects raw UK garage energy with sharp breaks and rhythms pulled straight from the city&#8217;s thriving underground scene. Over on the Modular Stage, <strong>Gotu Jim</strong> delivers a live performance that&#8217;s become legendary for fusing dark hip hop, house, and trap with splashes of hyper pop and emo house. His tracks capture that beautiful contradiction of nightlife—euphoric yet introspective, uplifting yet deeply emotional.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">DGTL favorite <strong>Jayda G</strong> makes her return, ready to light up the crowd with her irresistible fusion of disco, house, and funk. Beyond her infectious sound, she brings a message that resonates perfectly with DGTL&#8217;s ethos, including her powerful documentary <strong>Blue Carbon</strong>, which explores the intersection of music, science, and environmental awareness. The turntables will also see a special moment when <strong>Kamma</strong> and <strong>Yu Su</strong> join forces for their first-ever B2B set at DGTL—expect soulful grooves meeting cosmic house as Amsterdam&#8217;s flow intertwines with dreamy, textured soundscapes touched by subtle Chinese folk influences. And if you&#8217;re looking for something truly unforgettable, <strong>horsegiirL</strong>&#8216;s new audiovisual live show promises to blur the line between performance art and full-throttle rave, delivering an irreverent, surreal explosion of vocals, visuals, and hyperactive club energy.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Sunday April 5th brings the weekend to a spectacular close with a lineup that spans the entire electronic music spectrum. Fresh off his explosive ADE performance and that surprise pop-up rave at Amsterdam Central Station, Groningen&#8217;s <strong>Benwal</strong> returns with the unstoppable momentum that&#8217;s made him one of the Netherlands&#8217; fastest-rising stars. His sets are a high-octane blend of hard trance, rave, and house with contemporary twists that will leave you breathless. Grammy nominee <strong>Dom Dolla</strong> arrives with his crowd-pleasing house sound—groovy, powerful, and engineered for pure mass euphoria. On the more intense end,<strong> I Hate Models</strong> crafts emotional journeys through melancholic synthwave, trance, and industrial techno, creating that perfect fusion where raw aesthetics meet dance floor intensity.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Keep an eye on <strong>Odymel</strong>, whose eclectic mix of house, techno, trance, and eurodance has made him one of the scene&#8217;s most exciting new voices since his 2023 breakthrough. His melodies somehow feel both nostalgic and revolutionary at the same time. Berlin&#8217;s <strong>DJ Gigola</strong> brings her playful yet fierce approach, mixing techno, rap, and hyperpop into a uniquely infectious rave experience. Amsterdam&#8217;s own <strong>Luuk van Dijk</strong> delivers that recognizable warm, swinging house groove that keeps bodies moving, while <strong>Weval</strong> takes the stage with their cinematic live show that has evolved toward a more dancefloor-focused direction without losing any of that emotional depth and rich texture they&#8217;re known for.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"DGTL ADE 2025 | AFTERMOVIE\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkLTZrr22lA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n",

Rolling drums and a funky bassline riff provide a fast-flowing undercurrent for the track to rip through. His voice is tucked inside the mix, as the vocoded, wailing stabs spring into action with masterful precision. Meanwhile, liquid synth modulations and warbling melodic embellishments ebb and flow, which keep the groove dynamic and engaging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shedding light on an unforgettable weekend that served as the inspiration for his new single, <strong>George Smeddles </strong>says, “<em>The idea started when I was at Space closing during Miami Music Week.

The whole way through, he’s been treating the dancefloor with his eclectic excellence, drawing inspiration from funk, jazz, soul, motown, garage, and classic house music. With collaborations alongside respected peers such as <strong>Max Chapman, Darius Syrossian, </strong>and <strong>Secondcity, Smeddles </strong>has earned numerous <strong>Beatport #1 </strong>releases, which have cemented his status as a staple in the modern house scene.

A collaborative EP with Moxy Muzik frontman Darius Syrossian on DFTD also contributed to George&#8217;s ever-growing acclaim, hanging onto a #1 on Beatport for five solid weeks with &#8216;Back In The Dance&#8217;. Add to this an official remix of Indeep&#8217;s iconic &#8216;Last Night A DJ Saved My Life&#8217;. multiple Beatport #1&#8217;s and millions of streams, it&#8217;s fair to say that George is a widely respected producer in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as present outside of the studio as he is inside it, George is a committed performer with an impressive resume that spans the world over. Among the ever-growing list of his most notable appearances, Fabric London, Amnesia Ibiza, CRSSD Festival, and Glastonbury lead the way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Connect with George Smeddles&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Instagram</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Facebook</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Twitter</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>SoundCloud</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Spotify</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More about IN / ROTATION&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Launched in 2017, Insomniac’s IN / ROTATION is a label living under Insomniac Music Group that is dedicated to the freshest house sounds on heavy rotation.

This year’s lineup is stacked with both international heavyweights and local favorites, delivering a fiery soundtrack for the frigid months ahead. The opening weekend brings house-heavy headliners <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/?s=disco+lines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disco Lines</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/SOFI-TUKKER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOFI TUKKER</a>, and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/The-Blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Blaze</a>, setting the tone for another unforgettable season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each following weekend ups the ante with performances from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/DJ-Snake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Snake</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Madeon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Madeon</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Elderbrook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elderbrook</a>, Skull Machine — an explosive new bass project from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Black-Tiger-Sex-Machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black Tiger Sex Machine</a> and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Kai-Wachi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kai Wachi</a> – <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Max-Styler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Styler</a>, and a rare back-to-back set from techno queens, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Nicole-Moudaber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicole Moudaber</a> and Montréal’s own <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Misstress-Barbara\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Misstress Barbara</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Igloofest wouldn’t be Igloofest without showcasing the city’s thriving local scene. Collectives like Ferias and Homegrown Harvest return for stage takeovers, bringing the underground energy that defines Montréal’s dance music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Montréal wraps, the Igloofest tour heads across the country — touching down in Gatineau (February 12–14), Québec City (March 6–8), and making its first-ever appearance in Edmonton from March 13–15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contact.igloofest.ca/presale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pre-sale registration</a> opens November 6 at 11 a.m. ET, with general on-sale to follow November 7 via Igloofest’s official website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: Alexis Monet</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpEmAzEcH_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The project builds on the themes she explored in <em>Drenched</em> and <em>Infina</em>, pulling everything into sharper focus with a mix of live rig experimentation and detailed production choices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept comes from a poem she wrote in 2017 for her mother, using waves as a reminder of how we return to ourselves through repetition, grief, and small moments of renewal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"581\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/QRTR_ONDASlive_AbletonSession-1024x581.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82520\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/QRTR_ONDASlive_AbletonSession-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/QRTR_ONDASlive_AbletonSession-300x170.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/QRTR_ONDASlive_AbletonSession-768x436.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/QRTR_ONDASlive_AbletonSession-1536x872.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/QRTR_ONDASlive_AbletonSession-2048x1163.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the album, QRTR leans into the tools that shape her live performances and studio workflow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>ONDAS blends hardware synths, reverb manipulation, pad-driven textures, and custom MIDI control setups that allow her to reshape each idea in real time. Much of the record is tied to the physicality of her performance process, with vocal processing, live automation, and evolving synth patches giving the songs a sense of movement that mirrors the album’s central theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5iIc0ZZnzXf6POnkJNQdJX?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature breaks down the tools behind ONDAS using QRTR’s exact words. Each section highlights the hardware and plugins she relied on during production, how she used them, and how other producers can apply the same ideas in their own work. Her approach to building this album offers a clear look into the intersection of emotion, technical design, and performance energy that defines her sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Arturia Minifreak (Hardware Synth)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"653\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.55.34-AM-1024x653.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82521\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.55.34-AM-1024x653.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.55.34-AM-300x191.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.55.34-AM-768x490.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.55.34-AM.jpg 1336w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arturia Minifreak is a hybrid hardware synth with a built-in modulation matrix, onboard fx, step sequencing and arp functionality and that’s just what I use, barely scratching the surface of just how in the weeds you can get with this thing. The combination of all the digital synthesis processing you can do along with its analog filtering make for really rich and intricate synth patches that can be manipulated over and over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.02.41-AM-1024x726.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82529\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.02.41-AM-1024x726.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.02.41-AM-300x213.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.02.41-AM-768x545.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.02.41-AM.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My first Arturia hardware synth was the Microfreak and I found myself using it a lot in my productions, so when the Minifreak became available with dual oscillators and integrated effects (and a really solid physical build), it felt like a no brainer to have it for my studio. I love any synth (hardware or plugin) that lets me take a patch and run it through an arp or step-sequencer and this synth has it all onboard, so starting ideas is really intuitive. Since I used it so often in my production, it felt very organic finding ways to play certain things live with the same synth or even layering over variations of those same patches to give my songs some new flavor when I perform them live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you intend on incorporating a synth like the Minifreak into your live set to perform original music, my biggest advice is to make sure you are saving your custom presets and labeling them properly both in the synth itself but also in your DAW. You will save yourself the trouble of having to attempt to recreate a patch to perform live months (or years) after you’ve made the music, though trying to recreate a patch is a great challenge to get to know your gear better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Eventide Blackhole (Reverb Pedal)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.14-AM-1024x602.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82522\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.14-AM-1024x602.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.14-AM-300x176.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.14-AM-768x451.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.14-AM.jpg 1498w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Blackhole reverb pedal is a guitar pedal meant to process guitar tones into ethereal ambience. It doesn’t necessarily need to only be used with guitars, you can process anything you’d like through it to experiment with spatial dynamics. Standard reverb pedals try to replicate the sonics of different room reverbs you would find in the real world, whereas the Blackhole pedal allows you to create the reverb of virtual spaces that otherwise don’t exist. It can be used as its own instrument in a lot of ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This fx pedal was actually a Christmas gift for my girlfriend, but she kindly let me borrow it for this iteration of my live set. I used it more like an additional synth pad in my set by running my own vocals through it and then using my DAW and a controller to further manipulate the reverb signal that was created by me sending my vocal through. The pedal has the option to do an infinite reverb so once I liked how my voice was being effected, I had the flexibility to put my microphone down and continue to play with the parameters for all my fx with both hands without losing the signal. It resulted in sounding both ethereal and a little haunting, which is exactly what I’m going for with this live performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventide also offers a plugin version of this pedal that I highly recommend getting if you’re excited by the idea of using reverb as its own instrument. It can be a nice way to fill out a track similar to a synth pad, or you can actually use it as the focal point in a more ambient leaning project.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Novation LaunchControl XL (MIDI Controller)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"679\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.32-AM-1024x679.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82523\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.32-AM-1024x679.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.32-AM-300x199.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.32-AM-768x509.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.57.32-AM.jpg 1339w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Novation LaunchControl XL is a midi controller featuring assignable knobs, faders, and buttons. You can create various custom mappings depending on how you intend to use it, but essentially you use it to control your DAW however you need it for live automation in production or in live performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used the LaunchControl XL as part of the “fx station” of my live rig. I mapped all the knobs and faders to a macro fx rack I put together in Ableton featuring four custom reverb, delay/filter, gate and beat repeat effects. I ran my vocals, my hardware synth and select backing track stems through their own effect chains to manipulate them all individually as I liked. For my vocals, I ran the macro fx rack on the reverb signal from the Blackhole pedal specifically. The result of playing with these fx via the controller ranged from new bassline rhythms via gating, glitched out percussion with the beat repeat, to much bigger transitions between phrases and tracks with filtering and delay/reverb fx. Using this as part of my live rig was a way to keep all the music feeling fresh for people who may be more familiar with my discography, but also for myself despite my nonstop rehearsing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I highly recommend getting at least one midi controller that offers a range of knobs, faders, buttons because certain things physically feel more intuitive whether you want to very precisely turn some knobs or slam down a fader. I’ve found that honing in on tactile sensations that you enjoy helps a lot with live performance. Even in production settings, I like to use physical knobs and faders to record live automation for fx in my music. I think you can really feel the difference when automation is done live by a person and not just a perfect curve done with the click of a mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Novation Launchpad Mini (MIDI Controller)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"668\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.58.37-AM-1024x668.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82524\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.58.37-AM-1024x668.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.58.37-AM-300x196.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.58.37-AM-768x501.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.58.37-AM.jpg 1339w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Novation Launchpad Mini is another midi controller, but it only consists of 64 pads. They can be mapped to anything in your DAW, and each pad can be customized with specific colors, sensitivity and functionality. You can play it like an instrument triggering notes or drum samples, or map it to control your DAW without having to touch your computer keyboard or mouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I primarily used the Launchpad in my live rig to control my Ableton session. I mapped it to locators in my project so I could easily move between songs in my set via arrangement view. I also custom mapped a section of the controller that I could use to trigger notes for specific moments in songs that felt more intuitive to tap out instead of playing on keys. I used Novation’s Components software to customize the pad colors and responsiveness, so that I never needed to look at my DAW during my live performance to navigate my session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance pads can be a lot of fun for tapping in drums and controlling a project session without having to be glued to your computer screen, but there are some fun things you can do with it when writing melodies as well. A feature that made the Ableton Push so exciting was that it allowed you to lock the onboard pads to a specific key. You can rig any performance pad to do this by using Ableton’s Scale MIDI Effects. Once you have everything locked into a key, you can focus on exploring melodic rhythms by tapping out notes without worrying about memorizing what each pad is playing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Hot Takes About The Industry</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.59.30-AM-1024x649.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82526\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.59.30-AM-1024x649.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.59.30-AM-300x190.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.59.30-AM-768x487.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.59.30-AM.jpg 1449w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hot Take 1:</strong><br>My dream label reached out to me for demos, then proceeded to tell me to make music more like other mainstream dance acts that were blowing up at the time, so I stopped replying to those emails and decided to self-release this next album.

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

Joel Zimmerman, better known by his electronic dance music moniker, <a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=deadmau5\">deadmau5</a>, delivered a five-hour sonic journey that reminded everyone why he’s one of electronic music’s most inventive minds.

The line for the meet and greet was massive, so we skipped that part and waited in the merch line instead — and it was *so worth it.* Hidden behind what looked like a laundry room was a secret passageway leading into the merch area, where a giant Meowingtons blow-up greeted fans. The two “Day of the Dead” mau5 helmets were on display, and seeing them up close was unreal. There was no shortcuts taken in the fabrication of these helmets. </p>\n<p>The merch itself was next-level. Compared to the Red Rocks booth, this pop-up had far better selections and exclusives. I grabbed the deadmau5 letterman jacket, while my friend picked up a hoodie and shirt. The designs were clean, bold, and collector-worthy — a reminder not to miss the next pop-up event.</p>\n<p>Back at Red Rocks, the night kicked off right on schedule.</p>\n<p>Testpilot wasted no time tearing up the decks from 6:00 to 7:30. Joel came out in a hat instead of the helmet, locked in from the first beat. The set was dark, mechanical, and full of drive. Figure humanoids appeared on stage throughout, adding to the otherworldly vibe as the sun dipped behind the rocks.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"925\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221413\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3.jpg 925w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3-768x492.jpg 768w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3-95x60.jpg 95w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" /></center></p>\n<p>At 7:30, DEATHPIXIE took over — the first virtual artist ever signed to a major dance label. Her set was visually stunning and full of energy, especially with the addition of three live dancers. They gave the production a human element that helped bridge the digital and real worlds. It was unlike anything I’d seen at a mau5trap show before.</p>\n<p>Then, from 8:00 to 10:20, it was time for the main event. Deadmau5 returned to the stage, transitioning seamlessly from Testpilot’s grit to his signature cinematic sound. He dropped a brand-new unreleased track — easily one of the best of the night — and while I was hoping for “Monophobia,” it’s hard to complain with a catalog this deep. “Strobe” was a crowd favorite as always, and his collab with Kaskade, “Escape,” sent the entire amphitheater into pure chaos.</p>\n<p>Skylar Grey made a surprise appearance midway through, dressed in all red and completely owning the stage. Her live vocals on “My Heart Has Teeth” and “Let You Lie” with DEATHPIXIE gave the night a haunting, powerful touch.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"933\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221415\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5.jpg 933w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5-768x490.jpg 768w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5-95x60.jpg 95w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px\" /></center></p>\n<p>By the time the DnB Mau5 set started around 10:20, the energy was off the charts. It didn’t lean into the muddy UK grime style — instead, it kept that clean, polished deadmau5 texture. The transitions were flawless, the basslines sharp. You could tell Joel was in complete flow state. Around an hour and a half into the main set, something shifted — he stopped performing *at* the music and started performing *through* it.</p>\n<p>As the final track faded and lights dimmed, Joel grabbed the mic and said this was one of his top 10 sets ever. And I believe it. The crowd, the visuals, the sound — everything clicked in a way that felt timeless.</p>\n<p>It was an honor to photograph this show and capture a night that was pure artistry in motion. Huge thanks to Alex Greenberg and the entire deadmau5 team for the hospitality. This one will be hard to top.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"935\" height=\"623\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221412\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2.jpg 935w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px\" /></center></p>\n<p>“Follow” deadmau5 : | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=1fe640-1-1721663343551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=561c75-1-1721663343551\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soundcloud</a> |</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-at-red-rocks/\">A New Era Has Begun As Day Of The deadmau5 Makes History At Red Rocks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com\">thissongslaps.com - Electronic Dance Music &amp; Hip-Hop Media</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>A reinvention, whether of a genre, a style, or a particular song, is never a bad thing, especially when those who make up our present and who laid the foundations for what we now enjoy join together to continue making history. The release of &#8216;<strong>You Gonna Want Me (I Know)</strong>&#8216; is an example of that. Sees a meeting of two powerhouse forces in dance music: <strong>Tiga</strong>, the <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/5l9wiTZVfqQTfMDOt0HtwC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">boundary-pushing veteran DJ</a> and producer from Montreal, and <strong>MEDUZA</strong>, the Italian production trio whose ascent to global stardom has been meteoric.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiga, known for his unique blend of electroclash and techno with a touch of wry humor, is a long-standing figure in the electronic scene, constantly exploring new sounds and remixing acclaimed artists. The collaboration&#8217;s partner, <strong>MEDUZA</strong>, has become synonymous with massive club crossover hits since their 2019 breakout &#8216;<strong>Piece of Your Heart</strong>&#8216;, followed by other chart-toppers like &#8216;<strong>Lose Control</strong>&#8216; and &#8216;<strong>Paradise</strong>&#8216;, and has achieved over five billion streams combined across their records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to &#8216;<strong>You Gonna Want Me (I Know)</strong>&#8216;, it is a powerful and immediately engaging club record that fuses the melodic flair of <strong>MEDUZA</strong> with the edgy, underground spirit of <strong>Tiga</strong>. Serving as a dynamic update of a classic vocal, the track built a <strong>raw, grinding bassline</strong> and <strong>punchy, relentless house beat</strong> that drives it forward with undeniable floor-wrecking energy. The production is sharp and polished, balancing the familiar, iconic vocal hooks with a darker, more industrial-tinged Melodic House &amp; Techno soundscape, making it a compelling tool for DJs looking for a high-impact, crossover club hit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vocal makes reference to the song of the same name that Tiga himself released in 2025. This collaboration pays homage to this storied history, re-weaponizing Tiga&#8217;s famous 2005 rework by lifting the same memorable vocal and injecting it with their modern, dark melodic house sound, ensuring the vocal&#8217;s legacy continues on a new generation of dancefloors. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-meduza-tiga-you-gonna-want-me-i-know-references-and-reinvention\">Meduza/Tiga &#8211; &#8216;You Gonna Want Me (I Know)&#8217; References and Reinvention</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the original track, which was a fixture in the mid-2000s electro clash and techno scenes, was actually built around a significant sample from &#8216;<strong>I Know</strong>&#8216; by disco/soul artist <strong>Dave Crawford</strong>, released way back in 1973. Tiga took the powerful, swaggering vocal line, &#8220;<em>I know, you gonna want me, but when you want me, it might be a different story</em>&#8220;, and anchored it to his distinctively raw, driving electro production, turning a classic soul lament into a provocative club anthem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contribution of Meduza to the track is immediately apparent in the track&#8217;s contemporary, high-fidelity sound design and its shift towards the darker side of melodic house and techno. The Italian trio’s signature lies in their ability to craft an atmospheric yet driving soundscape, characterized by a raw, grinding synth bassline that delivers maximum impact, a key element in this rework. The new iteration replaces some elements of original work with a more <strong>pulsating, hypnotic beat structure</strong> and adds the sweeping, tension-building melodic layers that have defined their global hits. This polished, club-ready production ensures that the iconic vocal is firmly anchored in the modern dance music lexicon, guaranteeing its success on massive festival stages and dark, late-night floors alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In summary, this track is more than just a remix; it&#8217;s a floor-redefining moment that showcases the enduring power of Tiga’s underground flair married to global, festival-ready dominance. With MEDUZA’s new <strong>Aeterna Recordings</strong> label forging ahead, releases like this at prestigious labels, and Tiga’s legendary status continually evolving, this collaboration confirms both artists are operating at the peak of their influence. Be sure to follow Tiga and <strong>MEDUZA</strong> across their social channels to keep up with their constant stream of new releases, upcoming tour dates, and future collaborations that are certain to define the sound of the club landscape in the year to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can listen to <strong>MEDUZA</strong> &amp; <strong>Tiga</strong>&#8211; &#8216;<strong><em>You Gonna Want Me (I Know)&#8217; below</em></strong>! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: You Gonna Want Me (I Know) - Extended Mix\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/45WzSRDJXyPpDbF9VvpqPQ?si=2e6a61e2131e4e53&#038;nd=1&#038;dlsi=b680b2cc18c24d44&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/meduza-tiga-you-gonna-want-me/\">MEDUZA &amp; Tiga Release High-Energy Club Anthem &#8216;You Gonna Want Me&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation.

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

At each corner there are various food joints, amenities such as the Beauty Bar, and plenty of space to roam around. On the outer edges Headliners could find all the EDC essentials: info booths, merch tents, free water refills, and more! Light-up tunnels guide you into the colorful center of EDC and make for a great meeting spot with friends.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for a Wonderful EDC Las Vegas 2021!</h2>\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic was, and still is in many ways, a difficult time for everyone, but we are infinitely grateful to have been able to reunite with our Headliners this year Under The Electric Sky.

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

It goes by the name <strong>Chrysalis Music Festival</strong>, and it runs from <strong>May 14-16, 2026</strong> at <strong>Hotel El Ganzo</strong>&#8216;s <strong>Izkali Gardens </strong>venue in <strong>San José del Cabo, Mexico</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who, pray tell, will be performing there? Empire of the Sun, obviously — and three times, presumably once each day — but the remaining lineup has yet to be announced. For now, the &#8220;Alive&#8221; hitmakers have shared little more than the creative musings that inspired the direction of the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The festival’s story focuses on the circle of symbols: the door, the egg, key, wings and bell,” according to <strong>Luke Steele</strong>, one half of Empire of the Sun. “It’s in the Chrysalis that these symbols communicate to us like a secret language: The Door, the threshold. The Key, the revelation. The Bell, awakening. Wings, the future self and The Egg, beginnings. It’s about creating a journey through music, art and spirit. In a world that is overflowing with distortion, it’s time to let yourself be carried away.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steele formed Empire of the Sun alongside <strong>Nick Littlemore </strong>in 2007. The Australian duo released their first album, <em>Walking on a Dream</em>, the following year, including international smash hit &#8220;We Are The People.&#8221; Steele and Littlemore have released three albums since, the most recent of which was 2024&#8217;s <a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/2024/07/26/empire-of-the-sun-ask-that-god-review/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://edmidentity.com/2024/07/26/empire-of-the-sun-ask-that-god-review/\"><em>Ask That God</em>.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Presale goes live on Thursday, November 20 at 12pm PT, with the general on-sale following the next day.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>If you spend most of your time in the studio, you already know how stale your head can feel when you stay in one place too long. Getting outside clears up mental fog in a way no plugin or new workflow ever will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when someone like Hall of Fame skier Glen Plake talks about the gear he trusts, it’s worth paying attention. He’s built his life around reading terrain, adapting fast, and relying on equipment that keeps him locked in. There’s a very real parallel here for producers who want sharper sessions after stepping away from the desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This season, Plake is running the LEKI <a href=\"https://lekiusa.com/products/spitfire-3d_leki-usa_alpine-skiing-poles_winter?variant=45316626284838\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spitfire 3D Trigger</a> freeride poles and the Patrol 3D gloves. Both pieces are built with the same attention to detail and feel that producers look for in their favorite hardware. You want gear that disappears in your hands so you can focus on the experience.

It locks in quickly, stays secure, and lets you click out instantly when you need to. If you’ve ever dealt with traditional pole straps in cold weather, the difference is immediate. It works with the included wrist strap or with any LEKI Trigger glove, where you clip directly into the pole without adjusting anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82573\" style=\"width:374px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/65368022_3.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The poles also ship with interchangeable baskets for hardpack or deep snow, which makes them as useful for quick after-work laps as they are for full weekend missions.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>If you spend long hours in the studio, you probably know the mental fog that shows up once a session drags on. I have found that stepping outside for a real break works better than any plugin, preset, or caffeine run. A short overnight trip gives your brain space to reset. It creates distance from whatever loop you have spent too much time adjusting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is where gear like the <a href=\"https://hilleberg.com/eng/products/tent/akto-anniversary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hilleberg Akto Anniversary Edition</a> comes in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a one-person tent that delivers what you need for quick trips that clear your head and help you return to your work with sharper ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Akto has been around since 1995 and built its reputation through reliability, simplicity, and strong performance in every season. The Anniversary Edition keeps all of the core engineering intact and adds a lighter green fabric along with leather patches that match the older Hilleberg style. It is limited, which gives it a bit of collector appeal, but the value comes from how it feels in actual use. It is light, it packs down well, and it manages rough conditions with the kind of consistency that lets you focus on the reason you stepped outside in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Simple Shelter For When You Need To Step Away</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"711\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.48-PM-1024x711.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82566\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.48-PM-1024x711.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.48-PM-300x208.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.48-PM-768x534.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.48-PM.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Studio work benefits from breaks with real boundaries. When you head into the backcountry or a quiet campsite and zip into something like the Akto, the shift in environment helps you see your project from a new angle. The single pole design keeps setup quick. The vestibule gives you a spot for your pack, boots, and cooking gear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The interior is sized to give you enough room to sleep comfortably without adding bulk that slows you down. This mix of convenience and thoughtful construction removes stress from the process of stepping away for a night. You can leave the tent in your trunk, pick a trail, and reset your mind before heading back into production mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hilleberg built the original Akto after refining seventeen prototypes. That attention to detail shows up in how the tent handles heavy winds and shoulder season weather. Kerlon 1200 fabric forms the outer shell. The inner and outer tents pitch together. The pole sleeves keep everything stable once anchored with the ten included V pegs. The result is a shelter that stays dependable anywhere from easy forest sites to exposed high desert terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Limited Edition Built For Real Use</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.57-PM-1024x672.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82567\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.57-PM-1024x672.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.57-PM-300x197.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.57-PM-768x504.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.10.57-PM.jpg 1246w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anniversary Edition adds a commemorative leather patch on the tent and the bag, plus a sticker version for your water bottle or flight case. It keeps the same weight profile of roughly three pounds for the minimum trail load and under four for the packed kit. It remains small enough to carry on creative weekends that help you find new ideas away from the pressure of the studio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a reliable way to reset your creativity outdoors, the Akto Anniversary Edition offers a dependable and simple option that fits real use and long days in nature. It supports the kind of small trips that help your studio work stay fresh, intentional, and inspired.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/how-the-hilleberg-akto-helps-reset-your-creative-headspace/\">How the Hilleberg Akto Helps Reset Your Creative Headspace</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The partnership provides access to more than $500 million in capital that will be used to acquire and scale catalogs, labels, publishers, and other music-driven IP. The goal is to bring artist-side expertise into a part of the industry that is usually dominated by firms with little connection to the culture they are buying into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Harvey Tadman, President of Business Development and Co-Founder of The Circuit Group, explained that the fund is built around a simple idea. Culture should guide the decisions behind these assets. The Circuit Group has spent years inside electronic music, working directly with the artists who drive the space. Circuit Capital gives creators the option to partner with a team that understands the ecosystem rather than a financial entity with no ties to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why This Matters</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed by Create Music Group, the fund blends The Circuit Group’s cultural fluency with Create’s infrastructure, technology, and balance sheet. The approach is focused on building long-term value for catalogs and IP while keeping artists and entrepreneurs connected to the process. For artists who want to scale their rights or prepare for the future, the fund offers a path that aligns with the realities of modern electronic music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Create CFO William Smith said the partnership is a natural fit. He highlighted The Circuit Group’s record for helping clients grow meaningful assets, including recent high-profile transactions. Jonathan Strauss, Co-Founder and CEO of Create Music Group, said the collaboration aligns with Create’s mission to support artists and entrepreneurs through technology, financing, and long-term strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with catalog acquisitions, Circuit Capital will provide future-project financing for artists under The Circuit Group’s management. This includes back catalog investment and futures funding that artists can use to reinvest in their work and expand their creative plans. The Circuit Group’s roster includes FISHER, Chris Lake, deadmau5, Cloonee, Aluna, Ninajirachi, and others through management companies AYITA and Seven20.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">About The Circuit Group</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Circuit Group focuses on helping artists and songwriters strengthen ownership and control of their IP. Founded by Dean and Jessica Wilson of Seven20 with Brett Fischer, David Gray, and Harvey Tadman of AYITA, the company works with an artist-first mindset to build more equitable opportunities across electronic music.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/circuit-group-and-create-music-group-launch-nine-figure-fund-for-music-ip/\">Circuit Group and Create Music Group Launch Nine-Figure Fund for Music IP</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The key is to avoid cutting corners on memory and storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aim for 16 GB of RAM and at least a 512 GB SSD so your DAW, sample libraries, and plugins load without stalling. Something like the Dell 15 with a 13th gen Intel Core i5, 16 GB RAM, and 512 GB SSD gives you a workable Ableton or FL Studio setup that still stays budget friendly and easy to carry to gigs or writing sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mid Tier Laptops For Full Sessions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"589\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-5.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82535\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-5.png 589w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-5-300x205.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a main production machine that can run full arrangements, heavy soft synths, and mix sessions with lots of plugins, the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/dell-14-plus-laptop/spd/dell-db14250-laptop/usedb14250hbtshksp?_gl=1*gdjbtb*_up*MQ..*_gs*Nw..&amp;dclid=CPDww4mY_JADFcpALQQdKAYHcg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell 14 Plus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/dell-16-plus-laptop/spd/dell-db16250-laptop/usedb16250hbtshmhc?_gl=1*gdjbtb*_up*MQ..*_gs*Nw..&amp;dclid=CPDww4mY_JADFcpALQQdKAYHcg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">16 Plus</a> models are the sweet spot here. Configurations with Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9, 32 GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and a 1 to 2 TB SSD line up well with big project templates, orchestral libraries, and modern sound design tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2.5K displays help too, since you can keep your mixer, arrangement view, and key plugins visible without everything feeling cramped. These Plus models sit in a comfortable middle ground where you get close to desktop level power while staying portable for sessions, travel, and live setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Desktops, Monitors, And A Stable Studio Hub</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"242\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82536\" style=\"width:124px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6.png 242w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-6-181x300.png 181w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you prefer a fixed studio setup, the <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/dell-tower-desktop/spd/dell-ect1250-desktop/useect1250hbtshmqk?_gl=1*141arl*_up*MQ..*_gs*Nw..&amp;dclid=CPDww4mY_JADFcpALQQdKAYHcg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dell Tower</a> and <a href=\"https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals-for-business/dell-slim-desktop/spd/dell-ecs1250-slim-desktop/useecs1250pbtshmgp?_gl=1*gdjbtb*_up*MQ..*_gs*Nw..&amp;dclid=CPDww4mY_JADFcpALQQdKAYHcg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Slim Desktop</a> options with Intel Core Ultra 7 and 32 GB RAM give you a strong base for long term use. A tower will usually stay cooler and quieter during heavy loads and gives you room to expand with extra drives, audio interfaces, and backup storage. That becomes important once you are sitting on years of projects, sample packs, and multi track stems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monitor deals are quietly useful for producers too. The Dell 27 Plus QHD S2725DS hits a nice balance between size, clarity, and price. A 27 inch QHD screen gives you enough space for your mixer, arrangement, and a couple of plugin windows without constant resizing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you also game or do video work, something like the Alienware 32 4K QD OLED can double as a studio display and media screen without feeling like overkill.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Docks And Workflow Quality Of Life</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.21.13-AM-1024x342.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82537\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.21.13-AM-1024x342.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.21.13-AM-300x100.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.21.13-AM-768x256.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.21.13-AM-1536x513.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-9.21.13-AM.jpg 1795w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessories like the Pro Thunderbolt 4 dock are worth a look if your studio is full of external drives, MIDI controllers, and interfaces. One dock that handles power, displays, Ethernet, and USB through a single cable can clean up your desk and make it easier to move a laptop between home, studio, and office environments. For producers who bounce between rooms and setups, that kind of flexibility saves real time and hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Upgrading During This Sale Makes Sense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a budget perspective, the combination of several hundred dollars off, the extended price guarantee, and extra Dell Rewards points turns this into a legitimate chance to move up a tier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most producers, stepping into a 32 GB RAM and 1 TB or larger SSD machine will do more for daily workflow than almost any single plugin. If your current laptop drags every time you open a big session, this Black Friday window is a realistic moment to lock in a studio ready machine that will stay usable through the next few years of DAW and plugin updates.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/what-producers-should-grab-from-dells-black-friday-sale/\">What Producers Should Grab From Dell’s Black Friday Sale</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Richard Whittaker has shaped more than a thousand Dolby Atmos and Spatial Audio mixes, and his work spans legacy acts like The Who, Thin Lizzy, Robin Trower, Traffic, KISS, and Greg Lake, alongside contemporary artists such as Foals, Gabriels, and Biffy Clyro. At this point, his workflow feels like its own ecosystem. He runs the full SSL U Series controller lineup with the SSL 360 software environment, and that combination gives him the same confidence he had working on the original SSL consoles that shaped these records the first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whittaker studied Ambisonics and surround mixing long before Atmos became a global standard. As one of the first Atmos-accredited engineers in the U.K., he had already spent decades developing a feel for spatial work. That experience shaped his approach to remixing catalogue albums for artists who want their classic records to feel authentic in an immersive format. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"494\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.43-AM-1024x494.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82516\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.43-AM-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.43-AM-300x145.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.43-AM-768x371.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.43-AM.jpg 1473w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When he sits down to start a mix, he reaches for SSL’s official channel strip plug-ins for the 4000 B, E, G, and 9000 Series. Inside SSL 360, they appear in a traditional console layout, which makes the entire process feel familiar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He often begins by matching the tonality of the original stereo version, using recall notes and the SSL G Series channel strip as a starting point. Many of the original mixes were created on SSL desks, so he recreates the signal chain and carries that tone into the Atmos field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building an Immersive Workflow With SSL U Series Hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"933\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.51-AM-933x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82517\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.51-AM-933x1024.jpg 933w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.51-AM-273x300.jpg 273w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.51-AM-768x842.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-at-8.46.51-AM.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whittaker works on the full U Series range. That includes the UC1 controller, the UF8 fader unit, and more recently the UF1. Together they create a physical surface that responds the way an engineer expects. He prefers riding faders over drawing automation. The UF8 gives him eight motorized faders that feel natural for movement-based work. The UF1 adds a dedicated master fader that he uses for bus rides and longer transitions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also gets dedicated transport controls and a weighted scrub wheel that speeds up navigation across large sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UF1 ships with the SSL Meter plug-in, and the display on the hardware unit keeps level and phase information right in front of him. The hardware VU meter paired with the UC1 gives him another reference point while he works. He still uses hardware in his rack, including an SSL Fusion, and he plans to add the BUS+ compressor. Inside SSL 360, the Bus Compressor 2 plug-in is another core piece of his workflow because its behavior and tone feel true to the hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whittaker built a reputation for meticulous mix recreation. Clients often ask him to match the original stereo mix with precision. He researches the gear, the desks, the documentation, and the production history for each album. Once he recreates that core chain, he translates it into a full Atmos field. On recent projects such as the tenth anniversary Atmos remix of the Kiasmos debut, Michael Kiwanuka’s Small Changes, and the Yes album Fly from Here, that approach helped him preserve the spirit of each record while giving it a spatial update that felt natural.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/richard-whittaker-brings-classic-ssl-tone-into-dolby-atmos-with-the-ssl-u-series/\">Richard Whittaker Brings Classic SSL Tone Into Dolby Atmos With the SSL U Series</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

Online music promotion services have evolved fast, especially with Spotify music promotion, playlisting, targeted ads, and independent music PR teams building real momentum for emerging artists in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The landscape feels crowded, but there are clear standouts that actually move the needle and help you reach new listeners without wasting your budget. This guide highlights the best music promotion services for independent artists in 2026, based on the tools that created real, repeatable results in my own release cycles. Think of it as a shortcut through the chaos of Spotify playlist pitching, Meta ads, PR campaigns and algorithm-friendly strategies that actually build long-term growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal is to help you pick the services that genuinely amplify your releases and give you a cleaner path toward sustainable discovery. If you’re ready to plan smarter, promote music smarter and give your tracks the best possible shot in the current streaming ecosystem, these are independent music promotion platforms worth your attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"one-submit\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.one-submit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One Submit</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"686\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.51.27-AM-1024x686.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82461\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.51.27-AM-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.51.27-AM-300x201.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.51.27-AM-768x515.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.51.27-AM.jpg 1513w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One Submit became one of those music promotion companies I kept coming back to because of how easy it made the early traction stage feel (which is honestly one of the most complex parts of the whole hustle artists have to deal with these days).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a release hits Spotify playlists, blogs, radios, and YouTube channels at the same time, you start seeing momentum pile up in a way that feels natural and doesn’t just pump up vanity metrics on a single platform. I’ve had tracks enter a campaign and then quietly build little pockets of listeners that stuck around through later releases, which is all I really want out of a promo tool in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I like most is how hands-off the setup feels. You drop the track in, choose your lanes, and the engine does the heavy lifting. Whenever I’m in the middle of a release cycle and juggling artwork, masters, scheduling, and whatever is happening in life, having a tool that simplifies that stage is massive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One Submit is one of those music promotion sites that helps releases land in the right places without forcing a redesign of your entire workflow, and that alone makes it one of my first suggestions for artists looking for consistent growth this year. Notably, mention their Spotify promotion service which has big Spotify playlist curators database, and their TikTok music promotion plan, which can place your song with a TikToker who has between 500,000 and 5 million followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8a4e2PXgY0?si=ukwER7n46YYkEnWv\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"syncop-8-te\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.syncop8te.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Syncop8te</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"374\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.52.57-AM-1024x374.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82462\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.52.57-AM-1024x374.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.52.57-AM-300x110.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.52.57-AM-768x280.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.52.57-AM-1536x561.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.52.57-AM.png 1789w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.syncop8te.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Syncop8te</a> has a way of making a release feel bigger than you expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They build campaigns around structure, timing and storytelling, and that clarity is worth every penny during a busy release window.

The premium membership gives you email lists, analytics, distribution to music streaming services and a website builder in one spot, which means you save a ton of time hopping between platforms. When I started turning my releases into multi-month arcs instead of one-off drops, this workflow helped my brain stay organized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EPK tools and website builder are some of the most underrated features here. I’ve used them to pitch shows, send press materials and keep everything branded without overthinking it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the Gig Finder/opportunity system encourages you to think beyond streaming.

The algorithm responds to that consistent activity, and you’re not stuck rebuilding momentum from zero every time you drop something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curating the playlist myself also opened up opportunities on platforms that recognize playlist curators. That created leverage I never had before. When your playlist builds steady traffic, you gain access to rooms you typically can’t enter as a cold-pitching artist. And honestly, it feels good having something that keeps growing even when life gets busy. For me, this has become a long-term move, not a sprint, and it’s one of the most powerful music marketing strategies I recommend to artists in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the strategy we’ve been using to grow our own playlist, linked below, which has opened up other opportunities that act as force multipliers when combined with almost every other option on this list (as I kind of mentioned above). From world music to chill music, dance or hip hop, Meta ads works with different music genres while it allows to promote your playlist to the right audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/0DFG1AuTSRCVOeuFKA26SK?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"dispersion-pr\"><strong><a href=\"https://dispersionpr.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dispersion PR</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"525\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.56.53-AM-1024x525.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82465\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.56.53-AM-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.56.53-AM-300x154.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.56.53-AM-768x394.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.56.53-AM-1536x788.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-11.56.53-AM.jpg 1846w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dispersion PR brings a level of polish and industry reach that you feel the moment a campaign starts moving.

When a song lands here, it usually lands in the right context — the kind of Spotify playlist promotion that attract actual listeners who stay engaged. Those steady climbs show up in your monthly listener patterns, and the long-tail effect is real if your track fits the lane well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I appreciate most is how the reports teach you things you can’t get anywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing how curators responded, how listeners behaved and how long a placement held helps you shape future releases. I’ve used these insights to tweak arrangements, refine artwork and narrow my target music genres. If you approach it as both promo and research, Playlist Push becomes one of the most practical tools on this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"matt-caldwell-pr\"><strong><a href=\"https://www.mattcaldwell.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matt Caldwell PR</a></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"578\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-12.00.39-PM-1024x578.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82469\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-12.00.39-PM-1024x578.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-12.00.39-PM-300x169.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-12.00.39-PM-768x434.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-12.00.39-PM-1536x867.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-17-at-12.00.39-PM.png 1948w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image C/O Matt Caldwell PR</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mattcaldwell.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Matt Caldwell PR</a> operates more like a small creative agency than a traditional PR shop, and that’s why I ended up valuing them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They bring insight from management, booking and press, and that wider view helped me think about my releases as part of a longer arc instead of single-track bursts. When you’re juggling a growing catalog, that shift in thinking gives you a lot more breathing room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt the difference in how they approached story development. Instead of over-polishing the narrative, they help articulate what the music already communicates and build your career in a far more holistic way than just pumping the stream count on an EP, then moving on.

Every submission forces you to think carefully about who the track is for, and the feedback loop becomes addictive in the best way. When you start taking those small notes and applying them to your next mix or arrangement, you start noticing improvements across the board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform also helps me test tracks before launching larger campaigns. If a song consistently resonates with a specific curator type, that becomes a signal for my next steps. Even the rejections help clarify direction. I’ve learned a lot about my own genre lanes simply by watching what works here, and that kind of clarity ends up saving money and time in the long run.

I use it right after a release goes live because the rapid curator responses give the track immediate activity. Those early spikes help shape the algorithm’s understanding of where the song belongs, and that foundation pays off during the next few weeks of streaming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I like how global the curator music scene feels. You end up landing small and mid-tier placements across different regions, and those micro-clusters of listeners strengthen the song’s recommendation profile. Groover is the spark at the beginning of the release, and when paired with a broader campaign, it makes everything else feel smoother and more predictable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this being said, Groover has gotten some flak for low-quality feedback submissions and song rejections that just don’t make sense, so I encourage you to dabble with this one a bit and see if your music is a good fit for the curators who curate your sound.

After his well-received full-length &#8220;Oktopus Mekaniks&#8221; established him in underground club circuits, this new release refines his unique approach &#8211; sampling his own acoustic drum kit, sequencing it digitally, and essentially creating a &#8220;shortcut between the computer and himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead single &#8220;Shortcut Jenny&#8221; perfectly demonstrates this hybrid POV. Built around hunting-horn samples (courtesy of a friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s obscure record) and VAAGUE&#8217;s own voice, the track evolved from a happy accident &#8211; a digital synth preset that accidentally dropped pitch became the massive bass drop that anchors the UK Garage groove. Jennifer Lawrence interview snippets provide texture without imposing meaning, letting listeners create their own narrative. It&#8217;s the kind of innovative production approach you&#8217;d expect from someone who spent years mastering jazz before diving into electronic music from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes VAAGUE&#8217;s trajectory compelling is how completely he&#8217;s committed to this electronic persona. Starting with downtempo experiments on his 2021 self-titled EP, collaborating with Le Motel on 2022&#8217;s dancefloor-focused &#8220;From the Ashes,&#8221; and now fully embracing faster tempos and live playability on &#8220;SHORTCUT,&#8221; he&#8217;s methodically building a unique sonic identity. His background as a jazz bandleader informs everything &#8211; the complex choreography of his live stick performances, the compositional sophistication underlying even his most club-ready tracks. &#8220;SHORTCUT&#8221; proves the detour through jazz was actually the most direct route to somewhere genuinely original.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2KfrQENbQ6yI3Hmiki9iKy?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/401707/\">VAAGUE Teases Boundary-pushing EP with Lead Single &#8216;Shortcut Jenny&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>There’s something special about watching an artist evolve right before your eyes. For me, seeing the growth Sage (<a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=Devault\">Devault</a>) has made over the years has been nothing short of inspiring. From moody remixes that first caught fire online to commanding festival stages across the world, he’s carved his own lane—one defined by emotion, texture, and experience.</p>\n<p>Now, with “Feels Like Us,” released via John Summit’s commanding record label, Experts Only, Devault steps into a new era. The track blends nostalgic melodies with futuristic sound design. The chords keep you locked in, but the topline leaves us wanting more. It’s the kind of record that feels like late-night city lights and open highways, balancing introspection with release.</p>\n<p>Teased by John Summit at Experts Only Festival in NYC and Austin City Limits, the track has already stirred massive anticipation. Devault, known for drawing from Depeche Mode and Daft Punk, continues to refine his signature blend of dark energy and modern elegance—proving once again that emotion and innovation can coexist beautifully.</p>\n<p>“Feels Like Us” isn’t just another drop—it’s a statement. A reminder that Sage is still pushing boundaries, still growing, and still creating worlds through sound.</p>\n<p>Devault &#8211; Feels Like Us |</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2212026008&#038;color=%23cc0000&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/expertsonly\" title=\"Experts Only\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Experts Only</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/expertsonly/devault-feels-like-us-extended-mix\" title=\"Devault - Feels Like Us [Extended Mix]\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Devault &#8211; Feels Like Us [Extended Mix]</a></div>\n<p>&#8220;Follow” Devault : | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/devaultmusic\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devaultmusic\">X</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/devaultmusic\">Soundcloud</a> |</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/2025/11/devault-feels-like-us/\">Devault Takes a Cinematic Leap Forward “Feels Like Us&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com\">thissongslaps.com - Electronic Dance Music &amp; Hip-Hop Media</a>.</p>\n",

Another reminder that no one does high-tech minimal quite like Boris. <em>– Danielle Carty</em></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2tj1iOLK9Uwef7ooLgJMtJ?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/zenith/pl.u-38oWMM4FPbPMamB\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iammaesic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maesic</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/10/dancing-astronauts-new-music-friday-maesic-boris-brejcha-dimension-and-more-october-31-2025/\">Dancing Astronaut’s New Music Friday: Maesic, Boris Brejcha, Dimension, and more (October 31, 2025)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

The five-hour set will feature his techno alter-ego testpilot, new music from the upcoming album, and even a mau5 drum &amp; bass segment to close out the night — all wrapped in cutting-edge visuals and fresh stage design.</p>\n<p>To celebrate, Denver will host a two-day mau5hop pop-up at 95 S Cherokee Street, open from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fans can grab exclusive merch, including hoodies, vinyl, hats, and even a limited Atari x deadmau5 “Meowingtons’ Revenge” playable cartridge. deadmau5 himself will be there for meet-and-greets each day from noon to 3 p.m. Entry is free and open to all ages.</p>\n<p>With “Ameonna,” a new album on the horizon, and a fresh live experience about to debut, deadmau5 isn’t just returning — he’s reinventing.</p>\n<p>deadmau5 &#8211; Ameonna |</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2184808187&#038;color=%23cc0000&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" title=\"deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deadmau5</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5/ameonna\" title=\"Ameonna\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ameonna</a></div>\n<p>“Follow” deadmau5 : | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=1fe640-1-1721663343551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=561c75-1-1721663343551\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soundcloud</a> |</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/2025/10/deadmau5-new-single-ameonna-new-album-new-red-rocks-show/\">deadmau5 Is Back: New Single “Ameonna,” New Album, New Red Rocks Show</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com\">thissongslaps.com - Electronic Dance Music &amp; Hip-Hop Media</a>.</p>\n",
