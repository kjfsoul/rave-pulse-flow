      "fullContent": "\n<p><strong>John Summit</strong> releases his  ‘Silence’ remix with drum-and-bass staple, <strong>Dimension,</strong> through <strong>Tomorrowland Music</strong>. The <strong>Delerium</strong> rework has been one of the most requested IDs of the year after appearing at <strong>Ultra Europe</strong>, <strong>Red Rocks Amphitheater</strong>, and major festival sets across Summit’s massive global run. The track brings new life to a classic record that has already shaped decades of electronic music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-silence-remix-john-summit-dimension\">&#8216;Silence&#8217; Remix &#8211; John Summit, Dimension </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The remix opens with <strong>Sarah McLachlan</strong>’s familiar vocals, paired with a repeating synth that adds D&amp;B tension. The rework&#8217;s atmosphere forms as her dopamine-ripping chorus returns. As the build forms, the chorus becomes chopped and stuttered to push the energy higher. The pinnacle of energy launches into a powerful Dimension drop driven by rapid drums and a full low end. Euphoric John Summit synths arrive near the end, blending his melodic edge with Dimension’s familiar production.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Silence - John Summit Remix\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2OP7UAuQF1OJbjeYXa5fhm?si=0484b677068a48fe&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The break resets the mood and brings Sarah back into focus, letting the original lyrics breathe. Another build forms with tight percussion and ear candy textures. The final drop hits with a mix of Summit’s club-ready power and Dimension’s unmistakable drum-and-bass intensity. The result is a polished, high-impact rework that carries the emotion of the original while delivering the John Summit we all love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-artist\">The Artist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>John Summit is a Chicago-born DJ and producer popular for energetic sets and charting dance releases. His rapid rise includes performances at <strong>Lollapalooza Paris</strong>, <strong>Austin City Limits Festival</strong>, <strong>London’s O2 Arena</strong>, and countless more.

It was a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Expect for 2026</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers confirm that the <strong>2026 edition will expand its footprint, elevate its production, and continue growing the event’s dedicated community.</strong> While the full lineup is still under wraps, fans can expect more high-profile debuts, b2bs, and John Summit-curated surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More details, including the complete 2026 lineup, will be revealed over the coming months. But if you were at the 2025 edition, you already know Summit doesn’t play when it comes to production, scale, or energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPXOQQ6gWsA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "fullContent": "\n<p><strong>John Summit</strong> releases his  ‘Silence’ remix with drum-and-bass staple, <strong>Dimension,</strong> through <strong>Tomorrowland Music</strong>. The <strong>Delerium</strong> rework has been one of the most requested IDs of the year after appearing at <strong>Ultra Europe</strong>, <strong>Red Rocks Amphitheater</strong>, and major festival sets across Summit’s massive global run. The track brings new life to a classic record that has already shaped decades of electronic music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-silence-remix-john-summit-dimension\">&#8216;Silence&#8217; Remix &#8211; John Summit, Dimension </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The remix opens with <strong>Sarah McLachlan</strong>’s familiar vocals, paired with a repeating synth that adds D&amp;B tension. The rework&#8217;s atmosphere forms as her dopamine-ripping chorus returns. As the build forms, the chorus becomes chopped and stuttered to push the energy higher. The pinnacle of energy launches into a powerful Dimension drop driven by rapid drums and a full low end. Euphoric John Summit synths arrive near the end, blending his melodic edge with Dimension’s familiar production.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Silence - John Summit Remix\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2OP7UAuQF1OJbjeYXa5fhm?si=0484b677068a48fe&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The break resets the mood and brings Sarah back into focus, letting the original lyrics breathe. Another build forms with tight percussion and ear candy textures. The final drop hits with a mix of Summit’s club-ready power and Dimension’s unmistakable drum-and-bass intensity. The result is a polished, high-impact rework that carries the emotion of the original while delivering the John Summit we all love.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-artist\">The Artist</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>John Summit is a Chicago-born DJ and producer popular for energetic sets and charting dance releases. His rapid rise includes performances at <strong>Lollapalooza Paris</strong>, <strong>Austin City Limits Festival</strong>, <strong>London’s O2 Arena</strong>, and countless more.

It was a statement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What to Expect for 2026</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers confirm that the <strong>2026 edition will expand its footprint, elevate its production, and continue growing the event’s dedicated community.</strong> While the full lineup is still under wraps, fans can expect more high-profile debuts, b2bs, and John Summit-curated surprises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More details, including the complete 2026 lineup, will be revealed over the coming months. But if you were at the 2025 edition, you already know Summit doesn’t play when it comes to production, scale, or energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPXOQQ6gWsA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Can you believe we’re already talking summer festival season? As Toronto braces for winter, we’ve got something to look forward to—<strong>VELD’s 2026 lineup</strong> is here! From July 31 to August 2, <strong>Downsview Park </strong>will host Canada’s biggest EDM festival, and it’s back for its 13th edition, bigger and better than ever. This year’s lineup brings a massive mix of electronic genres, so bass lovers and techno fans are in for a treat. Check out the full lineup below and start planning those summer vibes now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-veld-2026-lineup\">Veld 2026 LineUp</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year than usual, VELD teased fans midweek with a stacked Phase 1 Mainstage lineup. It featured <strong>Above &amp; Beyond, Armin van Buuren, Fisher, Illenium, Kx5, </strong>and <strong>Mau P</strong>. <strong>Deadmau5 </strong>returns to his own festival with <strong>Kaskade </strong>as Kx5 for the first time. Above &amp; Beyond make their comeback after a successful<strong><em> Bigger Than All Of Us</em></strong> tour, while Illenium returns to the Mainstage following his 2023 set. Trance icon Armin van Buuren also rejoins the roster after last appearing in 2022. Just yesterday, Ink Entertainment dropped the full Phase 1 lineup, adding techno powerhouses Charlotte de Witte and Sara Landry to the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>VELD 2026 goes beyond the Mainstage with a lineup that spans the full electronic spectrum. Expect pounding techno from <strong>Lilly Palmer</strong> and <strong>Miss Monique</strong>, alongside bass-heavy chaos from <strong>Subtronics</strong>,<strong> Ray Volpe</strong>, and <strong>Level Up</strong>. <strong>SLANDER </strong>and <strong>Black Tiger Sex Machine</strong> bring melodic and aggressive bass, while<strong> James Hype </strong>and <strong>Galantis </strong>deliver house grooves and feel-good anthems. With <strong>Mau P</strong> and <strong>FISHER </strong>driving tech-house energy and <strong>Charlotte de Witte </strong>commanding the underground, this year’s festival promises a dynamic experience for fans of trance, house, techno, and bass alike. With so many big names in this lineup, we are hoping there are going to be 4 stages this year , excited to see how Downsview Park will transform for the 2026 Veld edition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join VELD and Ink Entertainment’s Instagram contest, open until November 26.

Anyone who works in small spaces already knows how rare it is to find portable speakers that translate well. The UNIT 4 sits in that category where you can trust what you are hearing without fighting the size of the box. At this price, it is one of the standout items of the entire sale period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marks the first time AIAIAI dropped the price on the <a href=\"https://aiaiai.audio/headphones/tma-2-dj-wireless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TMA 2 DJ Wireless </a>and the <a href=\"https://aiaiai.audio/headphones/tma-2-studio-wireless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TMA 2 Studio Wireless</a>. These two models tend to appeal to different corners of the community. The DJ Wireless version is built to take a beating and still feel comfortable through long sets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Studio Wireless version leans toward production and editing where reliability and clarity usually matter more than isolation. Seeing both discounted for the first time adds a good amount of weight to the sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aiaiai.audio/headphones/studio-headphones\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.32.09-AM-1024x560.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82798\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.32.09-AM-1024x560.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.32.09-AM-300x164.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.32.09-AM-768x420.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.32.09-AM-1536x840.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.32.09-AM.jpg 1693w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lower-priced models like the TMA 2 Move XE, TMA 2 Move, and the Tracks versions also received healthy cuts. These land in that entry point sweet spot where you can use them daily, toss them in a bag, and not worry about damaging something expensive. For friends and family buying holiday gifts for people in music, these are the models that will probably move fastest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Good Time to Build Out a Modular Headphone System</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons AIAIAI continues to be popular is the modular design of the TMA 2 line. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It makes parts easy to swap, upgrade, or reconfigure without buying a full new system. Black Friday creates a smart moment to pick up new drivers, headbands, or pads and shape a setup around the way you work. If you want to move from DJ work to production, or from production to travel, you can adapt the system without starting over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing to keep in mind is that stock usually shifts quickly once holiday shopping starts. UNIT 4 monitors, the DJ Wireless model, and the Studio Wireless model are often the first to disappear, so grabbing those earlier in the sale is the safer move.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/aiaiai-announces-black-friday-2025-deals-with-up-to-30-percent-off/\">AIAIAI Announces Black Friday 2025 Deals With Up to 30 Percent Off</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The trio opened their project and explained the synths, plugins, and processing chains that shaped each section. Their approach is built on intention and repetition, leaning into clean design choices that support the vocal while keeping the drop as heavy as it needs to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been following their recent releases on Monstercat, you can hear how their technique keeps developing with each project. The choices in this breakdown reflect the same mindset they bring to their live sets, focusing on sound quality, clarity, and weight. Everything here comes straight from the artists, word for word, so you can see precisely how “The Speaker” came together.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3kQYo33KoxYrraQsXZpGBk?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Serum 2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"619\" height=\"386\" src=\"blob:https://magneticmag.com/f3f1ff33-9a3c-49fd-8db7-c0a15f4a47d7\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably heard of this one, but Serum 2 is our go to plugin. For those who don’t know it yet; it’s an incredibly intuitive and versatile synth that does most kinds of synthesis and sampling. If you want you could even use it as kind of a DAW and build a tune in one instance of Serum 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Going through this project we realized that Serum 2 is in fact the only VSTi we used. The main lead (see screenshot) is the most characteristic sound we made with it for this tune. As you can see, we combined some basic waveforms playing higher harmonics on top of a sub. We then run it through a resonant flange filter to accentuate the screechy harmonics even more. In the FX section we use a lot of clipping and distortion, this is what really creates the character of the sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to make this type of sound filters like “flg” and “cmb” in Serum are fun to experiment with since they accentuate certain harmonics. Then in the FX section the “diode 1” distortion often gives it the right edge. If you want to use reverb, another great feature in Serum 2 is that you can sidechain the internal reverb with an envelope.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ENDLESS SMILE</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"832\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82786\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-8.jpg 832w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-8-300x153.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-8-768x391.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 832px) 100vw, 832px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another plugin we use in every project is Endless Smile by Dada Life. It’s an automatic buildup plugin with just one knob and 7 presets that range from a gentle filter + reverb build to very extreme ones with all sorts of pitch and phaser effects. In general, it’s great for making buildups that used to take a lot of time to make in a quick way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We mostly use it for its amazing reverb though. In the first preset called “fists in the air” you can use the know to slightly high pass and reverb a certain element, which gives it a very clean washed out feeling. So, on some background and pad sounds we keep it halfway on permanently. Apart from that we use it to wash out the lead bass at the end of each for bars, to make it hit harder again when the new 4 bars part starts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In any EDM genre you can just use this plugin as a one knob reverb, like we do. I think the main difference with other reverbs is that in Endless Smile the low end gets cut as you add more reverb, which prevents the reverb from making your mix muddy. My tip is to use it in a more static way on background sounds and in a more dynamic way, with lots of automation, on lead sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">StandardCLIP</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7-1024x701.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82785\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7-1024x701.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7-300x205.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7-768x526.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-7.png 1186w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This one gets used on almost every channel, it’s called StandardCLIP by SIR Audio Tools. It does exacly what the name suggests, it’s just a very simple clipping plugin that does exactly what it should do without any bells and whistles. I really like the simple yet effective visual feedback that the plugin provides so you know how hard you’re hitting the ceiling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For The Speaker the most apparent use is on the lead synth. When you make these kinds of rough synth sounds, clipping them really brings out the power. The lead synth in The Speaker we clipped so hard that you couldn’t even see it on the visualizer anymore (I think it’s around 12 dB of clipping). On top of that we used the softflipping setting at 80%, this brings up the quiet parts of a sound even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use StandardCLIP, or any other distortion plugin, it’s important to keep the sound clean. Between every stage of clipping and distorting we have an EQ or Soothe2 to clean up some of the muddiness and to make sure that the right frequencies are hitting the distortion. In general it can for example be nice to cut some low mids and turn up the mids before clipping, it’s something you have to experiment with though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Soothe2</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-1024x573.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82787\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-1024x573.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-300x168.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9-768x429.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-9.jpg 1488w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to the final plugin we want to talk about which is Soothe2 by Oeksound. It’s a plugin that’s used to clean up your sounds, or even multiple sounds when you use it on a bus. Soothe2 basically automatically finds nasty resonances and turns them down. You can adjust the range of frequencies it affects as well with the EQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We used it a lot for The Speaker as well, and again its most important use was on the lead synth. We did multiple stages of clipping, EQing and distorting, but after that the sound ended up a little harsh. We just put soothe2 on there with it’s default setting and turned up the depth a bit to taste. It made a huge difference to the sound of the lead, which would have been very exhausting to listen to otherwise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From our experience there are two main uses for Soothe. One of them is just for general clean up, like we did with our lead synth. The other one is to clean up specific areas. In a vocal for example you can sometimes find annoying peaks and resonances in the low mids. You can then isolate that specific range with the EQ in Soothe2 and let it work its magic in that area. A bonus use case it to use it as a sidechain plugin, by for example using the vocal as sidechain input, making it dip for example the instrumental at the exact frequencies where the vocal is hitting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quick Tips On Making Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"602\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.40-AM-1024x602.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82790\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.40-AM-1024x602.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.40-AM-300x176.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.40-AM-768x452.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.40-AM.jpg 1498w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip #1: </strong>Clip and Dip; Do multiple rounds of distorting/clipping a sound and cleaning them up with an EQ, until it sounds fat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip #2:</strong> Don’t be afraid to use samples and presets; a lot of big producers do. Creating a sick tune should be priority 1, making everything from scratch is fun, but not the most important part of making music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip #3: </strong>Less is More. The cliche holds up haha. As we progressed, we noticed that our tunes have fewer and fewer elements. It’s better to have one good lead, then to layer 5 mediocre leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip #4 : </strong>Take breaks and change playback environment. Leaving a tune for a day and coming back or playing it in the car, in the club, in the living room can give you a lot of info. Not even because of the different sound system, but to see if it conveys the feeling you want it to convey in those settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip #5</strong><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>: </strong>Work with others</span>. First of all, it’s inspiring and gives you input you wouldn’t get normally. Secondly, it’s a great way to learn new production techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.59-AM-1024x660.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82791\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.59-AM-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.59-AM-300x193.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.59-AM-768x495.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.14.59-AM.jpg 1526w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/how-it-was-made-t-sugah-grace-barton-the-speaker/\">How It Was Made: T &amp; Sugah, Grace Barton – “The Speaker”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p><strong>Zomboy</strong> returns with ‘<strong>Doomsday</strong>,’ his long-awaited debut on <strong>Bassrush Records</strong> and the fresh new set piece for <strong>Apocalypse: Zombieland 2025</strong>. The track arrives after months of global road-testing and lands as one of his heaviest weapons yet. Built for chaotic festival moments, it captures the raw intensity that has defined his music for more than a decade. The release also marks a milestone for <strong>Insomniac</strong>&#8216;s <strong>Bassrush</strong>, matching one of dubstep’s most explosive artists with its flagship event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-doomsday\">&#8216;Doomsday&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Doomsday’ starts with an eerie ambience and an early radio announcement broadcast that sets the D-Day tone. A raging build forms instantly, pulling listeners toward the edge of existence. The ominous radio voice returns with the phrase “<em>he is alive</em>,” launching the track into a sharp, relentless climb. The tension snaps into a synth fake-out, then spikes again towards a classic Zomboy drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Doomsday\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3Vk3AcdGJRwzgtjnRQUcqQ?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first drop hits with massive bass design, OG dubstep horns, rewinds, and jagged synth phrasing that cuts through the mix. It breaks only long enough to reset the tension. Another build forms, holding pressure without losing momentum, and drops into a second, heavy section that functions as a breakdown drop. After a brief atmospheric breath, the final build teases a possible hardstyle shift. Instead, Zomboy stays true to his roots and detonates a final dubstep drop shaped in the style of the first. The result is a weapon designed with precision for peak-festival energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-zomboy\">Zomboy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in <strong>Pendeen</strong>, <strong>Cornwall</strong>, Zomboy rose from rock and metal beginnings before shifting into electronic production. His early demos caught the attention of <strong>Never Say Die</strong> founder <strong>SKisM</strong>, which launched a rapid ascent that led to sets at <strong>Ministry of Sound</strong>, <strong>EDC Las Vegas</strong>, <strong>Red Rocks</strong>, and sold-out venues worldwide. His catalog includes classics like ‘<strong>Organ Donor</strong>,’ ‘<strong>Game Time</strong>,’ ‘<strong>Terror Squad</strong>,’ and ‘<strong>Like A Bitch</strong>,’ which helped define dubstep’s sharp, cinematic edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now steering his <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2024/10/zomboy-unleashes-album-dead-man-walking-pt-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dead Man Walking</a> imprint while maintaining a global touring presence, Zomboy continues to deliver music with precision, intent, and a dark theatricality that fans instantly recognize. His approach favors quality over quantity, often leaving space for production between releases to maintain the craftsmanship behind his sound.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"734\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-734x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393219\" style=\"width:626px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-734x1024.jpg 734w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-215x300.jpg 215w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-768x1071.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-1101x1536.jpg 1101w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-1469x2048.jpg 1469w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-696x971.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-1068x1489.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-1920x2678.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-301x420.jpg 301w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Flyer-Zom-2024-scaled.jpg 1836w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 734px) 100vw, 734px\" /></a></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/zomboy-doomsday/\">Zomboy Ignites Bassrush Records With New Single ‘Doomsday’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

The party, held on Saturday, November 8, 2025, was led by <strong>Padre Guilherme Peixoto</strong>, a Catholic priest who also works as a professional DJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event, which featured Dance music, lasers, and projection mapping, was held to celebrate the <strong>75th birthday of Archbishop Bernard Bober</strong>. The association between faith and rave culture generated <strong>instant controversy</strong>, with supporters praising the Church&#8217;s modern approach to connecting with youth, while critics denounced the fusion as sacrilege.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The connection to the Vatican was cemented when a <strong>video greeting from Pope Leo XIV</strong> was played on a large LED screen behind the DJ booth. The Pope, known for his progressive stance, expressed joy and called on the young people gathered to be &#8220;<em>witnesses of communion, builders of bridges, and sowers of trust</em>&#8220;. The recorded message is also used as part of Padre Guilherme&#8217;s original single, &#8216;Dear Young People&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRQvmggjMOs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Having gear that balances style, comfort, and security is crucial. Here’s what every festivalgoer should know before stepping through the gates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Packs: The All-Day Essential</strong><br>A hydration pack isn’t just for storage, it’s survival gear for long days and late nights. The best festival backpacks keep your water cold, your valuables protected, and your shoulders comfortable. Look for at least a 2 liter hydration capacity, insulation, anti-theft compartments that rest against your back, and padded straps for comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RaveRunner</a> has a number of <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hydration packs</a> that stand out for combining both functionality and design, making them one of the go-to sources for seasoned attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-theft design</strong>: The safest packs keep the main compartment against your back, making it nearly impossible for anyone to access while you’re dancing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration capacity</strong>: At minimum, you should look for a two-liter hydration pack so you can stay hydrated without constant refills that keep you off the dance floor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insulated or cooler-lined compartments</strong> so your drinks stay refreshing even after hours in the sun.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>All-day comfort</strong>: Padded straps, breathable materials, and balanced weight are non-negotiable when you’re wearing it from gates to afters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Festival-ready features</strong>: Bonus details like chest strap pockets give you a secure but easy-to-reach spot for valuables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Fanny Packs: Compact, Secure, and Versatile<br></strong>For instant access to your essentials on the dance floor, the hydration fanny pack is the perfect companion. They keep critical items like your phone, ID, and keys securely zipped against your body without weighing you down. Prioritize durable materials, tight zippers, and adjustable straps that can be worn crossbody or around the waist. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/hydration-bag/hydration-crossbody-fanny-pack-rave\">RaveRunner’s hydration fanny packs</a> deliver the comfort, flexibility, and anti-theft features you need for a worry-free night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration fanny pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Durable materials </strong>that won’t rip or tear if someone tries to force their way in.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Secure zippers or buckles </strong>that stay closed even when you’re in the middle of the crowd.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Room for hydration: </strong>space to stash a water bottle or soft flask can make a big difference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comfy &amp; Outfit-friendly</strong>: Find a pack that matches any look and is versatile enough to wear crossbody, around the waist, or slung over the shoulder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clear Bags: Staying Festival-Compliant</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.musicfestivalwizard.com/festival-bag-policy-changes-theft-why-clear-hydration-packs-and-fanny-packs-are-a-must/\">Clear bag policies</a> are now the standard at most major festivals, but that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice utility. Look for transparent bags that meet policy sizing, include hidden pockets, and maintain comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/product/anti-theft-clear-fanny-pack?type=rave\">RaveRunner’s clear fanny packs</a> and <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/product/clear-backpack-hydro-backpack?type=rave\">clear hydration backpacks</a> let you breeze through the entrance, offering peace of mind and keeping you gate-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a clear festival bag:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Policy-approved sizing</strong> so you don’t get turned away at the gate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anti-theft details</strong> like hidden pockets and secure buckles, because clear doesn’t mean unprotected.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comfort and versatility</strong>—the best designs let you wear them crossbody, as a sling, or around the waist without bouncing around.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration-ready options</strong> for anyone who wants the benefit of a bladder system without sacrificing compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choosing What’s Right for You</strong><br>Whether you need the capacity of a hydration pack, the quick access of a fanny pack, or a clear bag to meet gate compliance, choosing the right gear is crucial for a stress-free experience. Festival-ready bags keep your essentials secure, your hands free, and your focus on the music. Here&#8217;s some tips to help you decide what is right for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How much do you carry?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If you bring layers, merch, or snacks, a <strong>festival hydration pack</strong> has you covered.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you prefer essentials only, go for a <strong>hydration fanny pack</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do you need clear compliance?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the policy before you leave. A <strong>clear fanny pack</strong> or <strong>clear hydration backpack</strong> ensures you won’t be turned away at the entrance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What’s your comfort style?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Modular packs let you adjust—crossbody, waist, or sling—so you can dance without feeling restricted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Stay hydrated, stay secure: a guide to festival-ready hydration and fanny packs3\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-700x495.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401724\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-700x495.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3.jpg 1132w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: RaveRunner</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/stay-hydrated-stay-secure-a-guide-to-festival-ready-hydration-and-fanny-packs/\">Stay hydrated, stay secure: a guide to festival-ready hydration and fanny packs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

This year’s lineup is stacked with both international heavyweights and local favorites, delivering a fiery soundtrack for the frigid months ahead. The opening weekend brings house-heavy headliners <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/?s=disco+lines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disco Lines</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/SOFI-TUKKER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOFI TUKKER</a>, and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/The-Blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Blaze</a>, setting the tone for another unforgettable season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each following weekend ups the ante with performances from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/DJ-Snake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Snake</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Madeon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Madeon</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Elderbrook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elderbrook</a>, Skull Machine — an explosive new bass project from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Black-Tiger-Sex-Machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black Tiger Sex Machine</a> and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Kai-Wachi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kai Wachi</a> – <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Max-Styler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Styler</a>, and a rare back-to-back set from techno queens, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Nicole-Moudaber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicole Moudaber</a> and Montréal’s own <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Misstress-Barbara\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Misstress Barbara</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Igloofest wouldn’t be Igloofest without showcasing the city’s thriving local scene. Collectives like Ferias and Homegrown Harvest return for stage takeovers, bringing the underground energy that defines Montréal’s dance music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Montréal wraps, the Igloofest tour heads across the country — touching down in Gatineau (February 12–14), Québec City (March 6–8), and making its first-ever appearance in Edmonton from March 13–15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contact.igloofest.ca/presale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pre-sale registration</a> opens November 6 at 11 a.m. ET, with general on-sale to follow November 7 via Igloofest’s official website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: Alexis Monet</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpEmAzEcH_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Our inspiration has always been house music that makes you want to move the moment you hear it. When I got together with my friends, Mellizos, and we decided to collaborate on these tracks, the three of us had a clear vision: music that you could feel deep in your body and soul. We worked very quickly and knew from the outset that what we had created deserved to be among the greatest, and today we can confirm that we have achieved that.” &#8211;&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Alex Atenciano.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We really wanted to make something unique and standout, something that would get attention and be remembered. Every track in the EP has its own story, like when ‘Sabor De Noche’ got played by PAWSA, it was the first breakthrough we had and a sign that we found a sound that was truly ours.” &#8211;&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Mellizos.</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening with ‘Get Lit’, the title cut locks into a rolling rhythm from the start, rich chords with crisp percussion and infectious vocalsnippets. ‘Chatter’ keeps the energy levels simmering, driving momentum through tight drum programming and an elastic groove, before ‘Sabor De Noche’ closes the package with funky riffs, warm sonics, and playful energy perfect for notable moments. Showcasing two acts united by a shared feel for rhythm, the EP captures the collaborative spirit at the heart of Hottrax, a label consistently shining a light on emerging artists making a mark within the international club landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Mellizos &amp; Alex Atenciano ‘Get Lit’ EP drops via Hottrax on 21</strong><strong>st</strong><strong>&nbsp;November 2025.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Tracklist</strong><br />1.

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

      "fullContent": "\n<p><strong>Human Resource</strong>’s rave classic ‘<strong>Dominator</strong>’ returns in explosive form as <strong>Boys Noize</strong> delivers a high-energy rework that revives one of electronic music’s most iconic hooks for a new era. Leaning into the track’s original Hoover synth and memorable vocals, the GRAMMY-winning producer transforms the 1991 anthem into a modern techno weapon built for peak-hour moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dominator-boys-noize-rework\">&#8216;Dominator&#8217; &#8211; Boys Noize Rework</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Boys Noize ‘Dominator’ rework opens with a pounding techno kick and flashing sirens that set a ready-to-dance tone. The original Human Resource vocal, “<em>I want to kiss myself</em>,” jumps in first, followed by the iconic line that shaped early hardcore. As the phrase “<em>I am the one and only dominator</em>” fires, the track charges into its first drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Dominator\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7oZ8KZELVocU8WY2Ye7b3x?si=ca4bee3c266143ef&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The drop carries the classic Boys Noize energy, filled with attention-grabbing synths, playful sound design, and gritty textures. More lines from the 1991 anthem return during the break, including “<em>I’m bigger, I’m bolder, I&#8217;m rougher, I&#8217;m tougher,</em>” adding a familiar punch before the next surge. The second drop hits harder than the first, powered by a shuttering rhythm that moves with percision. A final drop lands with similar mind-wraping energy, capped by a signature sound design that twists the groove into a wild, club-ready spin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-some-background-on-dominator-by-human-resource\">Some background on ‘Dominator’ by Human Resource</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The original &#8216;Dominator’ became a global rave staple in 1991, reaching #6 on the <strong>Dutch Top 40</strong> and #36 on the <strong>U.K. Singles Chart.</strong> Its signature Hoover synth helped define the early hardcore and gabber sound. This made Human Resource into one of the first Dutch dance acts to break internationally. The Boys Noize ‘Dominator’ rework acts as a modern bridge. It pushes a rave classic into a new era without losing its core identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-boys-noize\">Boys Noize</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Boys Noize, the project of Berlin-based artist <strong>Alex Ridha</strong>, has built a global reputation on banger tracks, memorable performances, and fearless sound design. Also, as a GRAMMY-winning producer, DJ, he blends techno, electro, house, and experimental edges with a forward-thinking approach. This mindset and career has shaped those genres and inspired rising artists. His work spans festival stages, underground rooms, film scores, and fashion collaborations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Ridha’s catalog includes productions for artist like<strong> A$AP Rocky</strong> and <strong>Frank Ocean</strong>. Also, countless remixes, some of which were for <strong>Daft Punk</strong> and <strong>Depeche Mode</strong>. Continuing, his massive catalog of club hits such as &#8216;<strong>Mvinline</strong>’ and &#8216;<strong>Fine Day Anthem</strong>’. Through all these releases, he keeps one mission at the center: make music built for the dance floor and the fans who fuel it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"972\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393392\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1.jpg 972w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1-300x184.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1-768x472.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1-696x427.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1-684x420.jpg 684w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a9217284-d5d7-11ee-954e-0ecc81f4ee58-972x597-1-356x220.jpg 356w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 972px) 100vw, 972px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Boys Noize via Insomniac</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/boys-noize-reimagines-human-resource-dominator/\">Boys Noize Reimagines Human Resource ‘Dominator’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

The track arrives with major anticipation as both artists are two key figures changing the modern bass scene. Released on <strong>Armada Music</strong>, the label adds the record to its new wave of dance music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-dominator\">&#8216;Dominator&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The song opens with the original rebellious vocal that delivers the line &#8220;<em>I am the one and only dominator.</em>&#8221; The OG Human Resource synths and new drums follow and set a hard-hitting dubstep tone. The energy rises with layered percussion that builds toward a classic fake-out moment. The tension snaps into a fast-paced drop filled with crisp movement and detailed sound design. The second half of the drop leans into sustained bass hits that shake the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rework then shifts into war-like horns that create a dramatic pause. A melodic soundscape builds above them and widens the world of the song. The momentum returns as the elements rise together once again. Another fake out arrives to surprise listeners and flips the energy into a techno-heavy drop that still carries RL Grime’s signature dubstep feel. This rework of &#8216;Dominator&#8217; takes genre-blending and new production styles to a whole new level.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Dominator\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6C9beIn45G34tT8pQ61ed7?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-artist-behind-the-dominator-rework\">The Artist Behind The &#8216;Dominator&#8217; Rework</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-rl-grime\">RL Grime </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RL Grime came to fame in New York as a teenager with viral remixes of &#8216;<strong>Love Sosa</strong>&#8216; by <strong>Chief Keef</strong> and &#8216;<strong>Mercy</strong>&#8216; by <strong>Kanye West</strong>.

After several lineup changes through the mid-90s, the group disbanded near the end of the decade. <strong>Guido Pernet</strong> later revived Human Resource with a new lineup in the 2000s, leading to renewed touring and the launch of the Dominator Festival in 2005, which remains one of the biggest events in hardcore and gabber music.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"youtube-embed\" data-video_id=\"x2LQ5L9pUVo\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Human Resource - Dominator (Original)\" width=\"696\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2LQ5L9pUVo?feature=oembed&#038;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/rl-grime-deadcrow-dominator/\">RL Grime And Deadcrow Unite For Explosive New Rework &#8216;Dominator&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

The new five-track EP, <strong>‘Order In Chaos,’</strong> sees the Italian maestro team up with acclaimed violinist and composer <strong>Vito Gatto</strong> for a stunning sonic triptych that defies traditional techno boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out Today, the release is centered on the concept that &#8220;Chaos is fundamental for creating something powerful.&#8221; Sangiuliano and Gatto blend electronic, classical, and electro-acoustic elements to create a journey through three distinct phases: tension, release, and dissolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-thematic-breakdown-of-the-ep\">Thematic Breakdown of the EP</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The EP is a masterclass in conceptual sound design:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>&#8216;Adaptation for Strings and 909&#8217; (Enrico Sangiuliano &amp; Vito Gatto):</strong> The cinematic overture sets the tone, built on the raw intimacy of Gatto&#8217;s processed violin soaring over the unquantized, &#8220;out of grid&#8221; pulse of an iconic Roland 909 drum machine. This is disorder made beautiful.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&#8216;Order in Chaos (Reactive Mix)&#8217; (Enrico Sangiuliano):</strong> The title track is pure, rolling techno fury. It serves as the &#8220;release&#8221; point, a hard-hitting weapon where a shape-shifting lead synth flirts with total breakdown before the thunderous kick restores the dance floor&#8217;s gravity.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&#8216;Dissolution&#8217; (Enrico Sangiuliano &amp; Vito Gatto):</strong> The closing track provides beatless surrender. Strings and drums slowly dissolve into a weightless drone, guiding the listener into a final, infinite space.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Countdown Continues</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1010\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-1024x1010.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393061\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-1024x1010.png 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-300x296.png 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-768x757.png 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-696x686.png 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-1068x1053.png 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM-426x420.png 426w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screen-Shot-2025-11-18-at-6.11.55-PM.png 1296w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Order In Chaos’ is release <strong>#1</strong> in the monumental NINETOZERO project. The label is a time-bound endeavor that intentionally counts down to <strong>#0</strong>, challenging the idea of perpetual music and encouraging listeners to focus on the present. With just one chapter left, the final moment promises to be something &#8220;unexpected and brilliantly innovative&#8221; from Sangiuliano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This groundbreaking release sets the stage for Sangiuliano&#8217;s highly anticipated <strong>all-night-long SOLO show at Nitsa in Barcelona</strong> on November 28th, where he will undoubtedly integrate the cinematic and chaotic soundscapes of this new EP.

Starting production at 12 and playing clubs by 14, he quickly rose from Liverpool newcomer to international standout. His early releases gained major DJ support and led to a viral Boiler Room debut at 16, followed by key signings with Teletech and standout tracks on Reckless, Taapion, HEKATE, and We Are The Brave. With major festival appearances and a debut album on the way, Farell champions the idea that age is no barrier to making an impact in electronic music.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-music\">Why music?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>⁠I’ve always listened to music religiously since I can remember.

I kind of gave up in school from the age of about 13.

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation. His &#8220;One Sound, Two Sides&#8221; philosophy translates into production that feels equally at home during peak-time festival moments and those rare club instances when everyone actually connects with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What separates this from typical progressive fare is TR3AL&#8217;s stated ambition beyond the booth. He&#8217;s developing a fully immersive live show incorporating visuals and motion-capture characters, treating each release as a narrative chapter rather than isolated singles.

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The festivities spanned two days and yielded a weekend of much-needed revelry for all the souls who dared step foot on these ancient grounds.</p>\n<p>Headliners traveled from near and far to take part in this ghastly observance of Halloween, and we were thrilled to see each and every one of them again. But don&#8217;t be afraid of the dark; the neon lights of the stages were there to guide us into eternal rave bliss. Check out our recap video below and read on to catch some of the festival highlights from this weekend.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVvpDwcsmRB/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

At each corner there are various food joints, amenities such as the Beauty Bar, and plenty of space to roam around. On the outer edges Headliners could find all the EDC essentials: info booths, merch tents, free water refills, and more! Light-up tunnels guide you into the colorful center of EDC and make for a great meeting spot with friends.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for a Wonderful EDC Las Vegas 2021!</h2>\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic was, and still is in many ways, a difficult time for everyone, but we are infinitely grateful to have been able to reunite with our Headliners this year Under The Electric Sky.

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

As well as that, the venue continues its bold programming with a lineup that honours house and techno’s past, present and future, culminating in Last Night on Earth label head and enduring electronic legend Sasha with Vivian Wang on December 31 and Victor Calderone, Avision and Jivan Calderone for New Year’s Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of that REFUGE’s late-fall and early-winter programming brings a dynamic mix of international heavyweights, New York icons, and rising talents across house and techno. November closes with Battle Hymn taking over the room with J. Aria, Michael Magnan and Donofrio, followed by stacked Saturdays featuring Tim Green, Anthony Middleton, Ranger Trucco and Claudio. The month continues with Serge Devant’s “After” session, Tony Humphries for Sunday Selectors and a special Thanksgiving Eve with Natalia Roth, Shahar and Jean Pierre, before Battle Hymn returns for a holiday edition with Dane Deveraux, Eli Escobar and Tom Peters. Finally, Joey Llanos and Shorty step in for another Sunday Selectors session.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"740\" height=\"555\" data-attachment-id=\"69712\" data-permalink=\"https://www.thenocturnaltimes.com/refuge-nyc-just-released-their-early-winter-lineups/refuge-comp-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?fit=1890%2C1417&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1890,1417\" data-comments-opened=\"0\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"refuge-comp-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?fit=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?fit=740%2C555&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?resize=740%2C555&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-69712\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?w=1890&amp;ssl=1 1890w, https://i0.wp.com/www.thenocturnaltimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/refuge-comp-02.jpg?w=1480&amp;ssl=1 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>December rolls in with a UK trio of Josh Butler, Liam Palmer, Elliot Schooling and Heidy P, followed by Chuwee &amp; Matisa, plus a sunrise after-hours on the 14th with Serge Devant &amp; Dimatteo.

      "fullContent": "\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Azzecca launches into a new orbit with the debut of her Cosimea Sounds label and the release of her whimsical, new single, &#8220;AL&#8217;s HOT SOUP.&#8221;<br /></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>Chicago&#8217;s underground electronic music scene is erupting with fresh talent, and <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/azzecca/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"23621\">Azzecca</a></strong> is one of the brightest sparks driving its momentum. Dubbed the &#8220;cosmic queen,&#8221; she delivers high-energy house, techno, and acid sounds that strike a unique balance between darkness and pure euphoria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her distinctive style comes to life at <strong>Cosimea</strong>,<strong> </strong>the event series she rebranded last year from the celebrated, female-safety-focused <strong>Dirty Disco</strong>. In just over a year, Cosimea has quickly become a community favorite, uniting party-goers through inclusive spaces and forward-thinking music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Azzecca is taking that vision even further with the launch of her new imprint,<strong> Cosimea Sounds</strong>. Through the label, she aims to create more platforms for diverse artists while curating a sonically rich, community-focused environment. Describing the imprint as a home for &#8220;an exploration of otherworldly club sounds,&#8221; Azzecca invites fans on a journey into the cosmic, transportive music that defines her signature style.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p><em>Cosimea began as an event project aimed at building community and recentering the focus on the dancefloor</em>. <em>Building this cosmic ‘world’ and having the freedom to play outside-of-the-box music lead to an obvious shift in my production process and finished projects. I knew I needed to create a platform to release the sounds that I feel really proud of, without the pressure of needing to fit into the current label landscape. I look forward to eventually using the label to platform other artists and sounds that break the formula and move me.</em></p><cite>Azzecca </cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Coinciding with the label launch, Azzecca has released its debut track, &#8220;<strong>AL&#8217;s HOT SOUP</strong>,&#8221; a playful, community-centered anthem featuring cats and aliens. Inspired by her notorious homemade soups from her popular social media series, titled <em>Hot Soup and Hot Takes</em>, the track kicks off with thick, rolling basslines that churn beneath stabbing synths. Its futuristic vibe is layered with spectral vocal cries and melodic accents, which perfectly capture Azzecca&#8217;s extraterrestrial aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her new label, busy tour schedule, and the ever-evolving Cosimea event series, Azzecca is proving she&#8217;s not just a rising talent but is ready to take the world by storm. Fans can experience her signature, otherworldly sound firsthand at upcoming Cosimea events, including shows at LA&#8217;s Sound Nightclub with artists like Ugo Banchi and Soraya, and at Chicago&#8217;s Cermak Hall with Eli Escobar, Ariel Zetina, and Baltra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Listen to &#8220;AL&#8217;S HOT SOUP&#8221; on Spotify or <a href=\"https://drop.cobrand.com/d/Azzecca/als-hot-soup?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnJdlwDqeGGvftyUhf2JBMMYWlddvVSTvqUjiDyosaTyyQ-YfiOQii3KnFuFQ_aem_7yK622RQM42NnXN5L8arOQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">your preferred platform</a>, and keep an ear out for what Azzecca has planned next for Cosimea Sounds by following her social media channels.</strong><br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Stream Azzecca &#8211; &#8220;AL’S HOT SOUP&#8221;</strong> <strong>on Spotify:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: AL&amp;apos;S HOT SOUP\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6VZaiqbYfSfWCgpCUlJwIJ?si=KfzE2Qf8RWmxTJarGWuQig&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"Azzecca - AL'S HOT SOUP\" class=\"wp-image-271557\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-500x500.png 500w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-150x150.png 150w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-768x768.png 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-75x75.png 75w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-350x350.png 350w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-750x750.png 750w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART-1140x1140.png 1140w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ART.png 1500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow Azzecca:</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/azzeccamusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/azzecca/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/azzecca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SoundCloud</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2k5DY2QDU3kBi5DX7OQlWj?si=9aAIeGaFTL-0iBV2IGiQxw&amp;nd=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@azzeccamusic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">TikTok</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com/2025/11/21/azzecca-cosimea-sounds-als-hot-soup/\">Azzecca Unveils New Imprint, Cosimea Sounds, with Latest Single</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com\">EDM Identity</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>STS9 closed out 2025 with <em>Human Dream</em>, a release that marked a major moment for a band that built its identity on long-form exploration, community, and live performance. The project arrived on November 21 through 1320 Records and landed after ten years without a full-length studio album. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group approached this record with a calm, grounded focus, recording everything in their own space for the first time. That decision shaped the entire mood of the album and allowed them to work with complete control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Snag The Vinyl <a href=\"https://sts9.com/products/human-dream-2xlp-deluxe-vinyl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Here</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/17NIrbENVwMt4X60sV57hZ?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Across 19 tracks, STS9 leaned into their core strengths. They moved between funk, jazz, and electronic ideas with a confidence that came from nearly three decades of touring, writing, and improvising together. The album centered on questions they have raised for most of their career. How do people connect. How does art influence the way people process collective tension. How does sound help mark time. Those ideas were present throughout the record and created a throughline that felt honest to where the band stood in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Record Formed During A Challenging Period</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-88-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82833\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-88-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-88-300x300.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-88-150x150.jpg 150w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-88-768x768.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-88.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The album began during a difficult stretch in Santa Cruz. A major wildfire hit the area, burned more than eighty thousand acres, and forced the band to physically move their studio to protect their equipment. That period shaped the tone of the project. They worked in temporary spaces with smoke-heavy skies outside and used the process as a stabilizing routine. It gave the writing a clear sense of focus. They built the material piece by piece and allowed the environment to influence the energy without forcing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That context carried into the themes of <em>Human Dream</em>. The band aimed to reflect on daily perception, the difference between surface-level activity and deeper internal movement, and the value of slowing down long enough to notice those shifts. They wanted the record to feel grounded without relying on grand statements. Tracks like “Presence of Light” highlighted that mindset with calm melodies and steady momentum, offering a clear entry point into the rest of the album.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A Clear Step Forward For A Group With A Long History</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>STS9’s lineup of Hunter Brown, Jeffree Lerner, David Phipps, Zach Velmer, and Alana Rocklin has been stable for years, and that experience showed through the entire record. Their past work across drum and bass, funk, and instrument-driven house informed the pacing without locking them into a single direction. <em>Human Dream</em> functioned as a snapshot of where they currently stood and how they responded to change and disruption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than thirty shows planned across 2025 and 2026, the band shifted their focus back toward the stage immediately after the record dropped. The release served as a strong foundation for the next cycle of their live work, giving fans a large, detailed project to sit with before the tour moved across major markets.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/sts9-marked-a-new-chapter-with-their-first-album-in-ten-years-human-dream/\">STS9 Marked A New Chapter With Their First Album In Ten Years, Human Dream</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Darius Syrossian has always treated DJing like a living, reactive craft. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hear that mindset all over his new Hot Creations release, a two-track EP built for packed rooms and sharp shifts in energy. Both cuts carry the hallmarks of his approach: direct, groove-first, and shaped for those moments when a crowd is ready for something bold. The title track with Cortez Walls already made its way around Ibiza this summer, turning into one of those records people hunt for long after the night ends.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/5mGD1C80VPiXsNB7Dsf1Ep?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>His interviews often circle back to the same core idea. The room tells you everything. The crowd shows you when you can push, when you can twist the energy, and when a curveball might hit harder than anything planned. That instinct sits at the center of this release. It comes from decades spent in record shops, residencies, and clubs where instinct mattered more than trends. When he talks about risk, he talks like someone who has lived through countless shifts in the scene without losing his taste or his timing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview steps deeper into that mindset as Darius breaks down how he reads a room, why he files music by emotion instead of genre, and how risky track selections often lead to the most memorable reactions. It’s the same philosophy that shaped this new EP. Direct, functional, and rooted in a clear sense of identity. For anyone who cares about how great DJs make decisions under the pressure of a crowded floor, his perspective hits with the same force as the music he’s releasing right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Darius Syrossian’s Socials</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/darius_syrossian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/dariussyrossian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Soundcloud</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6PDUdAoMV9dMy0wOt09Rsf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s the last track you played that felt like a real gamble—and what made you do it anyway?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I dropped High Contrast’s &#8216;Racing Green&#8217; once at the end of a set. I’d absolutely smashed it already, and the crowd were chanting for one more tune, even though I’d already given them two extra “one more tunes”, haha. I thought, right, let’s finish on a massive curveball. And it still went down great!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.33-AM-1024x787.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82802\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.33-AM-1024x787.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.33-AM-300x230.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.33-AM-768x590.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.33-AM.jpg 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide when a track is worth risking the vibe of the room for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just need to be good at reading the crowd. I always say the biggest skill in being a good DJ is reading the crowd; seeing what the energy is, and what energy can be created from what’s already in front of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Someone messaged me on Instagram the other day asking when I’m next playing in his city, and said he last heard me at UNVRS Ibiza. His exact words were that the energy of the room changed as soon as I came on, and it was one of the best sets he’d ever heard. That’s a massive compliment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I’d been there a good 45 minutes before I went on, analysing the room and itching to get started because I knew exactly what I could do to take things up a level. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t even go in hard, quite the opposite. I went very garage-influenced but upped the tempo, mixed quickly, switched basslines, and threw acapellas over grooves. The set flew by because I was enjoying it so much, haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1010\" height=\"869\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.44-AM.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82803\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.44-AM.jpg 1010w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.44-AM-300x258.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-10.52.44-AM-768x661.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you ever feel like you have to earn the crowd’s trust before you can take that kind of risk?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think if you’re playing the right party, somewhere the crowd are there for you, and know you’re not afraid to take risks or do something unexpected, then you’re fine. I’ve spent 15 years touring, and I’m well known for mixing genres and leaning into a more Balearic style. So if anything, if I didn’t do that, something would feel wrong, haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, there are only two types of music: good music and bad music. I don’t care for genre names. I don’t even file my USBs by genre, I file them by emotion. You can have a melancholy techno track, a funky techno track, a fierce techno track… it’s all about what fits the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I see a club or festival vibing to a more upbeat, funky energy, I’ll go in with funky techno, old Derrick May or Claude Young, for example, and happily throw in some Dub Syndicate garage or even some Carl Craig.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Has a “risky” track ever completely changed the energy of a set for the better?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At DC10 last summer, I was deep into a slamming, tribal vibe and it was going great- but I wanted to push things. Out of nowhere I dropped MPH’s &#8216;One Sixty&#8217;.

The label made its debut on November 21 with <em>Malibu</em>, a sunlit single that captures the easy flow and coastal calm of California. Built around smooth guitars, indie-leaning vocals, and a breezy rhythmic drive, <em>Malibu</em> sets the tone for what listeners can expect from the imprint: music that feels intimate, organic, and emotionally grounded.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3XovubwzGKYpP9Aite7eV9?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>While Sekora has long been known for melodic and uplifting releases, <em>Sekora Chill</em> takes that ethos into a more introspective direction. Inspired by the coastlines of Malibu and Big Sur, the label’s focus lies in music that blends melody and atmosphere, creating space for reflection without losing the warmth that defines UOAK’s sound. The track itself feels like a deep exhale after a long drive — the perfect introduction to the world Sekora Chill is building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We caught up with UOAK to talk about why now felt like the right moment to launch a new imprint, how <em>Malibu</em> came together, and what defines this new chapter for Sekora.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interview with UOAK</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6544-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82374\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6544-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6544-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6544-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6544-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6544-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What made now feel like the right time to start a new imprint under the Sekora name?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sekora has long been known for its melodic and fairly “chill” sound, but the aim has always been to create a natural blend between melodic, organic, and club-friendly electronic music. A blend that works just as well for casual listening as it does on the dance floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, we’ve released a strong selection of downtempo and chill tracks that have always fit the Sekora vibe. However, with my growing experience in hosting club events and my own lifestyle and listening habits evolving, it felt right to separate the energy between bigger, more club-oriented tracks and mellow tunes meant for easy listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, Sekora has never been a genre-specific label, it’s always been about a feeling. Sekora Chill captures a slightly different and more introspective version of that feeling we’ve come to know and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did the idea for Sekora Chill first start taking shape?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04118-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82377\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04118-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04118-300x200.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04118-768x512.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04118-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC04118-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been traveling to California for years, it’s had a special place in my heart for as long as I can remember. Sekora itself is inspired by the Sequoia trees, embodying our “where nature meets electronic music” ethos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pacific coastlines have also been a major source of inspiration. While the woods and outdoors evoke a more energetic and active atmosphere, the shores invite me to mellow down, reflect, and look inward as I stare toward the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During recent trips, driving down the coast, it really hit me: Sekora should have a dedicated outlet for that feeling, with complementary artwork that visually matches the sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRSHALQiHJy/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It’s right next to Los Angeles, and you can feel the shift from “busy” to “chill.” The song was born from my long drives down the Pacific Coast Highway. Waves crashing, seagulls overhead, which you can actually hear in the background of the track. It’s literally me describing those carefree drives with friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lyrics mostly repeat a simple phrase, intentionally keeping it uncomplicated. I wanted to invite listeners to just let go and feel that same sense of freedom I had during those moments. Not a care in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What defines a “gentler” or more introspective approach to electronic music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronic dance music often comes with the idea that louder means better. Many producers rely on tricks to boost energy and make tracks more club-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Sekora Chill, I took our signature melodic approach and stripped away the high-energy elements. When you focus on melody and harmony, often through pianos, organic textures, and acoustic sounds, you invite listeners into a more reflective, emotional journey rather than a purely energetic one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s about creating a flow that feels natural, like water, removing the harshness and allowing the music to breathe. It’s electronic music not just for the dance floor, but for the soul.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you plan to keep the label’s sound cohesive while still leaving room for variety among artists?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6675-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82375\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6675-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6675-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6675-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6675-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6675-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sekora is melody, nature and emotionally driven. It always has been and will be. What separates the main label from Sekora Chill is simply the energy of the track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every release on Sekora could be stripped down and turned into a chill track, that’s what makes our music so unique. The melodies and harmonies are already there. Because of their higher energy elements, synths, drums, and basslines they also work well in the clubs when played at a higher tempo. Sekora features the perfect cross-over tracks from home listening to playing them in clubs or at festivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sekora Chill, meanwhile, is focused purely on the easy listening experience, diving deeper into organic, analog instruments and soundscapes while staying true to the melodic DNA our listeners love. It’s a natural transition for our artists, close to home, yet offering a new and exciting way to express themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s next after “Malibu”? Are there follow-up releases or collaborations already in motion?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following <em>Malibu</em>, we have upcoming releases from Matt Leger, Banaati, Lobono, Lara Nord, and a lineup of familiar Sekora artists, along with some new, high-profile names we’re excited to reveal in the coming year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By making the first release a UOAK original, I wanted to signal to both existing and new artists that Sekora Chill isn’t just another sub-label, it’s a new chapter of its own, treated with the same love and care as the original Sekora imprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d love for artists reading this to join the journey by sending in their unreleased demos for consideration. We listen to everything.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/sekora-chill-begins-a-new-chapter-for-uoak-and-his-label-family/\">Sekora Chill Begins a New Chapter for UOAK and His Label Family</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The project moved from a fun creative experiment into a full record that had its own pulse, its own shape, and a clear vision of how electronic production can evolve when ideas flow naturally. HALO arrived at the right moment for both of them, capturing a style that feels confident and fully formed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creative process behind the track reflected that same energy. Each section leaned on tools that have become central to their workflow, from Keyscape shaping the piano foundation to Sonalksis Creative Filter driving movement across the mix. Nothing here feels accidental. Every choice pushes the track toward a clear identity that stands out within modern electronic music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This edition of How It Was Made walks through the exact tools, settings, and decisions used to build HALO. Everything below comes straight from the artist so you can see the workflow in full detail and apply similar ideas in their own sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Keyscape</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Keyscape-1024x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82734\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Keyscape-1024x583.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Keyscape-300x171.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Keyscape-768x437.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Keyscape.jpg 1160w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyscape isn’t another piano plugin. It is a meticulously sampled sonic powerhouse from Spectrasonics. Every note is captured with surgical precision, including velocity nuances, sympathetic resonances, and even the mechanical noises of hammers and pedals. The result is pianos that feel alive, responsive, and brimming with character. Whether you need the warm grain of a vintage Steinway or the crystal clear sparkle of a modern Yamaha, Keyscape delivers an unmatched palette of sounds, all wrapped in a user friendly interface that sparks creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For HALO, I relied heavily on the “1955 NY Steinway D – Close” preset for its perfect balance of presence and depth. I recorded my Chopin interpretations live, then automated the “Tone Control” to shift the piano’s brightness throughout the track, moving from a soft, veiled tone to a more percussive attack during the climax. I maxed out the “Pedal Noise” parameter for added realism and followed up with a touch of Valhalla VintageVerb to place the piano in an immersive space without smothering the transients. To top it off, I layered in “Tack Piano” for a lo fi, organic edge, especially in the rhythmic sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re producing electronic, ambient, or neoclassical tracks, Keyscape can be your secret weapon. Less is more. Start with a clean preset like “CP-70 Vintage” or “Rhodes Suitcase,” shape it with the built in EQ, and add effects sparingly. Pro tip. Automate the “Dynamic Response” to vary the keyboard’s sensitivity and create dynamic contrasts. And don’t be afraid to repurpose prepared pianos or vintage keys for unexpected textures. That’s how I found HALO’s signature sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sonalksis Creative Filter</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"898\" height=\"842\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.48.54.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82737\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.48.54.jpg 898w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.48.54-300x281.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.48.54-768x720.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 898px) 100vw, 898px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, Sonalksis Creative Filter might seem like another filter plugin, but it’s so much more. It’s a precision tool that combines surgical grade EQ, dynamic filtering, and intuitive modulation in a sleek, user friendly interface. What sets it apart is its ability to deliver everything from subtle tonal shaping to wild, rhythmic filter sweeps without feeling overwhelming. Whether you need a gentle high pass to clean up a bassline or a resonant low pass that pulses with your track, Creative Filter makes it effortless with a sound quality that is always musical and never harsh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my recent project, I used Creative Filter on almost every channel. On the main synth lead, I used the “Resonant LP” preset, automated the cutoff with a slow LFO to create a breathing texture, and then sidechained it to the kick for rhythmic movement. For the drums, I set up a “Dynamic HP” to tighten up the low end, using the built in envelope follower to duck the filter only when the bass drum hit. And on the vocal chops, I dialed in a “Notch + Width” combination to carve out space in the mix while adding stereo magic. The best part. It never felt like work. It felt like pure, intuitive sound design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re making electronic, ambient, or pop, Creative Filter deserves a spot in your toolkit. Start simple. Use it to clean up muddy lows or add air to your highs, then dive into modulation for movement and energy. Pro tip. Automate the “Q” parameter to create tension before a drop or breakdown. And don’t overlook the “Mix” knob. Blending the filtered and dry signals can add depth without losing punch.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kilohearts Trance Gate</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"386\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.50.22-386x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82736\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.50.22-386x1024.png 386w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.50.22-113x300.png 113w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.50.22.png 480w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 386px) 100vw, 386px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kilohearts Trance Gate might look like a simple effect at first, but the plugin is a powerhouse designed to chop, pulse, and rhythmically transform any sound with precision. It delivers that signature trance gating that defined an era. Think stuttering leads, pumping pads, and sequences that move with infectious energy. It blends retro gated textures with a modern polish, which works perfectly in classic trance and modern electronic tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use Trance Gate on nearly every lead and pad sequence. For my latest track, I loaded it onto a supersaw lead, dialed in the “16th Note” preset, and tweaked the “Gate” and “Smooth” knobs to create a tight, rhythmic stutter that locked with the kick. On my ambient pads, I switched to “Dotted 8th” for an undulating effect, then automated the “Mix” parameter to slowly introduce the gating before the drop. The result is a sound that feels nostalgic and fresh, with that recognizable Kilohearts punch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re producing trance, progressive, or any style that leans on rhythm and movement, Trance Gate is a strong addition to your workflow. Start with the built in patterns, then tweak the “Swing” and “Offset” settings to match your groove. Pro tip. Layer it lightly on reverb tails or delays for rhythmic interest without pushing the effect too far.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Baby Audio Transit 2</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"778\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.51.55-1024x778.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82735\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.51.55-1024x778.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.51.55-300x228.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.51.55-768x583.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.51.55-1536x1167.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Capture-decran-2025-11-14-a-23.51.55-2048x1556.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Transit 2 might look like a transition plugin, but it is a full creative engine. It excels at build ups, sweeps, and drops, but its real strength comes from the little details. It adds movement and texture to nearly anything. From tape stops and vinyl noise to glitch stutters and reversed effects, Transit 2 reshapes sounds in a way that sparks new ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use Transit 2 in a wide range of situations. In my latest project, I used the “Tape Stop” preset to create a slowing effect on my synth leads before a drop, then automated the “Grain” parameter to introduce glitch artifacts. For drum fills, I layered the “Reverse” mode with a bit of “Bit Crush” to get an unusual uplift. And on pads, I added “Vinyl Noise” for an analog feel that sits neatly in the mix. Every preset is tweakable, so it becomes yours quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your workflow needs transitions with character, Transit 2 is a strong pick. Start with the built in transition modes, then explore creative layers like Grain or Pitch. Pro tip. Automate the “Mix” knob to blend effects in and out smoothly. The “Random” function can also spark new ideas and unlock directions you might not expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quick Fire Tips for Making Electronic Music</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.17.51-AM-1024x663.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82780\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.17.51-AM-1024x663.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.17.51-AM-300x194.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.17.51-AM-768x497.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.17.51-AM-1536x994.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.17.51-AM.jpg 1574w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tip #1: Bounce your audio, mangle it, then bounce it again.<br>Tip #2: Layer your leads with subtle detuned duplicates and a touch of chorus for width and movement.<br>Tip #3: Automate everything.

The structure reflected the influence he picked up during his exploration of beat switch techniques, and it created a clear lift halfway through without abandoning the momentum he built during the opening section. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He described the track as a reflection of the pressure artists place on themselves when chasing success, and that intention carried through the way he shaped the arrangement. The electronic foundation remained central, yet the delivery felt far more raw, with details that pointed toward the French electronic sound he grew up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What He&#8217;s Been Up To</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.14.07-AM-1024x489.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82777\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.14.07-AM-1024x489.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.14.07-AM-300x143.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.14.07-AM-768x366.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.14.07-AM-1536x733.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-21-at-9.14.07-AM-2048x977.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The release followed a long run of activity during a busy year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His September single “Hi!” earned widespread attention, leading to coverage from Billboard, The Needle Drop, and multiple electronic outlets. He also debuted an ambitious stage production during his sold out Red Rocks headline performance, paired with a fan pop-up in Los Angeles that drew lines throughout the day. These moments showcased a renewed focus on immersion, visual direction, and a level of creative control that had been developing since his Good Faith era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Madeon’s path over the last few years included a Grammy nomination for Good Faith, studio work with Lady Gaga, and a series of high-profile festival sets, including his widely praised Coachella performance.

His catalog holds a level of intention that rewards close listening, which is why the re-framing of his Prologue-era work on <em>Epilogue</em> feels so timely. Field Records pulled together a body of music that still shapes how producers think about rhythm, movement, and sonic identity. It gives long-time followers and newer listeners a way to hear the precision and focus that defined a pivotal stretch in his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0X7rjLEoNpO01qKEvJkTuw?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes this release moment interesting is the context around it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parker has been open about how his taste formed, the scenes that shaped him, and the ways he navigated periods when the wider direction of techno moved somewhere else. The Prologue material captured a point where repetition, reduction, and spatial design pushed his sound into new territory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That period also reflects a mindset he continues to carry today, which is clear in how he talks about memory, influence, and consistency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interview adds another layer to the release because we go straight into how he thinks about selectors, crowd reactions, early influences, and the parts of his taste that never shift. The perspective here sets up <em>Epilogue</em> as more than archival material and highlights the ideas behind the work, the years that shaped it, and the approach that keeps his catalog steady while the environment around it changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"564\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-1024x564.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82771\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-1024x564.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-300x165.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-768x423.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-1536x845.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-2048x1127.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you think your taste says something specific about who you are, not just as a DJ but as a person?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was kid, my parents gifted me a book about Leonardo da Vinci. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t a big reader then, but I was fascinated by the images, especially the drawings. Consciously or not, I think I appreciated the idea that a person can express themselves without speaking. Techno music is often like that, expressive without words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you ever held back from playing something you love because you weren’t sure how it would be received?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on the venue, New Years Eve events can be challenging. It might be a mix of people who specifically came out to experience my sound, plus a bunch of other revelers who want to hear the pounding of thump, thump, thump and crushing hi hats. I can try to lead them into a deeper mix, but if that does not work, well then, pound it out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On such a night as that, I might hold back from playing something that leans towards an ambient feeling. On the positive side, I get to play some favourites from the 90&#8217;s because the younger audiences perhaps haven&#8217;t heard them before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s a sound or mood that you always come back to, no matter where the scene goes?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound of the acidic TB-303 never really goes away. Periodically it trends back in waves or revivals. But really, it cuts through a mix so beautifully and it is irresistible. My TB-303 was modified years ago so that it could accept input signals from other synths. After all these years, its elastic sound can still resonate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-square-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82772\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-square-2.jpg 600w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-square-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Mike-Parker-square-2-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you think taste is something you’re born with or something you build?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is built on life experience. I was fortunate to be exposed to free-form college radio when I was younger. There were several university radio stations operating in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States where I grew up. They presented music that was outside the mainstream of commercial radio. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the 9:30 Club in Washington DC became a destination for me, as it was the premier venue for interesting and forward thinking music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What would someone not understand about you if they only heard your most popular sets?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that people will seek out my recorded sets of ambient and experimental music, such as the mix I made for Dekmantel in 2019. I try to include history in those mixes, sometimes with electronic music that goes all the way back to mid-century recordings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have always said that the sounds are as important as the beats. The sounds are what attracted me to this music in the first place. I pay attention to sound design in movies. Not surprisingly, some of my favorite film soundtracks are electronic in nature, such as Forbidden Planet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82773\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press-Shot-Mike-Parker-1-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Has your taste ever put you at odds with the direction the scene was heading?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was that way in the early days of running my label. Later, during the mid-aughts the minimal club sound was big. By that I mean the ping-pong minimal stuff that never interested me. I was waiting for that trend to play itself out. So I spent more time in the studio making what I wanted to hear. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, I expanded my sound into halftime and d&amp;b tempos. I like this freedom to make anything without the concern of what is in favor at the moment. I also hope this scene gets past some of the goofy performative stuff we have been seeing behind the decks lately. The beauty of this music was that the audience became more aware of their own experience while listening to it, not focused on watching the DJ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s a track that feels like a personal signature, not because it is rare, but because it is you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will highlight Subterranean Liquid, which appeared on my first Prologue EP and is now featured on the compilation Epilogue. Prologue understood my vision and encouraged me to do whatever I wanted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They brought my sound to a whole new audience and supported the visual art on the record jackets. That track is a tunneling vortex. I recently played it at Nowadays in New York City.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/inside-mike-parkers-mind-the-influences-and-foundations-behind-epilogue/\">Inside Mike Parker’s Mind: The Influences and Foundations Behind Epilogue</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The two-track EP landed on 21 November 2025 and added a fresh chapter to a catalog that has shaped underground electronic music for more than twenty years. The project connected his low-end-driven approach with the steady lift of house in a way that felt confident and direct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scuba</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/scubaofficial/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;/<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/scubaofficial\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/48hZklIMPklae2Mssfp8Cx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3dovrCdT7Wd78G52MnWNt3?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Scenes and Sounds</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Paul Rose, known globally as Scuba, had already built a long legacy across multiple eras of UK and European club culture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His role in pushing dubstep forward through Hotflush Recordings placed him at the center of a movement that influenced a generation of producers. His SUB:STANCE residency at Berghain later became one of the defining pillars of that period, giving him a platform to refine his sound and expand into techno, house, and hybrid forms that carried his style forward without losing its foundation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across this progression, he pushed long-term development for artists through Hotflush, releasing early music from names like Joy Orbison and Mount Kimbie. He also delivered respected mixes for DJ Kicks, Fabric, and Ostgut Ton, reinforcing his reputation as someone who understood how to shape momentum across both clubs and recorded formats. His 2024 Digital Underground live tour expanded his reach even further, followed by a run of dates across Asia that touched Kyoto, Nagoya, Tokyo, Koh Phangan, Singapore, Danang, Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Beijing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Inside “GetUppp”</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The title track carried a steady forward lift built around clean percussion and subtle vocal detail. The rhythm moved with tight control, giving the groove freedom to build without rushing. The bassline locked everything into place with a sense of movement shaped for late hours and rising floors. “406 Dub” took a deeper route and leaned into space, tension, and repetition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The production relied on atmosphere and pulse, drawing from the spirit of dub techno while keeping everything centered on flow and rhythm. His Crosstown Rebels debut landed at a moment when he had reconnected with the live side of his work and reinforced why he remained one of electronic music’s most respected voices. “GetUppp” added another layer to his evolution and demonstrated his ability to bring experience into a new context with precision and intent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/scuba-made-his-crosstown-rebels-debut-with-getuppp/\">Scuba Made His Crosstown Rebels Debut with “GetUppp”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",
