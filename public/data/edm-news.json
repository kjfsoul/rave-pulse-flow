It’s a life-affirming journey that blends music, adventure, connection, and transformation into something deeper. More than one hundred weddings and proposals have taken place at sea. Thousands of friendships, creative partnerships, and breakthroughs have started on board. Captains describe it as a family reunion with people they didn’t know they had.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-next-evolution\">The Next Evolution</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GC27 will expand its transformational programming with the next evolution of The Groove Effect and the 8 Waves. This energetic roadmap guides captains through tuning their frequency, exploring curiosity, breaking comfort zones, owning their groove, entering flow, elevating others, sparking ripples of impact, and stepping into the infinite. It’s designed to help people return home changed in the best possible way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sailing from Miami, Florida, on January 21, Groove Cruise invites past Captains and new #GCFAM alike to indulge in a once-in-a-lifetime experience aboard Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas, which just underwent $100 million renovations. The sailing will feature 96 hours of nonstop music and connection, as well as Groove Cruise’s signature immersive programming, which will include 13 stages of transformation, globally renowned artists, daily themes with dedicated parties, artist-hosted activities, beachside destination parties, the Whet Foundation volunteer experience, mental health panels, and so much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-awards-galore\">Awards Galore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Awarded <strong>Best Large Cruise Ship </strong>by<strong> GOLD Travvy Awards</strong>, <strong>Best For Entertainment </strong>by <strong>Cruisers’ Choice Awards</strong>, and <strong>Best Individual Cruise Ship </strong>by <strong>Readers’ Choice Awards</strong>, Allure of the Seas will be the&nbsp;most updated&nbsp;Groove Cruise ship to date and will be the biggest music cruise of any genre in history. Allure of the Seas is part of the Oasis Class of cruise ships, which is the largest ship class in the world with a length of over 1,187 ft, 18 total decks, and a full capacity of 6,780 passengers.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Every so often, an artist appears with a story that grows layer by layer, lesson by lesson &#8211; until suddenly you realize they’ve built something with real gravity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6Datf4DQVupApdYWbBny3w?si=w8opixA9Q0GurQoxlm7aKA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OGGY</a>, the London-based singer, songwriter, and actress also known as Olga Savic, is one of those artists. Her new single, “Another Dream&#8221;, is certainly the moment all the years of training, self-doubt, persistence, and late-night open-mic courage converge into a sound that finally speaks in her own voice.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Another Dream\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1nMRro0Y0pcSoFrdGQrDp0?si=ec05134876f84d61&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>OGGY’s journey didn’t begin with her debut single. It began long before, in private vocal lessons, in the halls of Kingston University where she earned her MMus in Music Performance, in the quiet discipline of learning guitar, piano, and ukulele, and in the slow construction of artistic confidence. Unfortunately, that confidence didn’t come easy. For years she struggled to believe she had anything singular to offer until a short songwriting course with Aidan Martin became a turning point. Melody and emotional honesty revealed themselves as her native language.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"688\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1571-688x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82433\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1571-688x1024.jpg 688w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1571-201x300.jpg 201w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1571-768x1144.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1571-1031x1536.jpg 1031w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1571.jpg 1320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Another Dream” carries the echoes of that. It’s a pop-rock release with the emotional voltage of Fall Out Boy, but its centre of gravity is unmistakably hers. The chorus (“Another dream come to end… A thousand dreams will die again”) sits at the intersection of longing and resignation, a place where love dissolves but the heart isn’t quite ready to follow. OGGY writes from lived experience, but aims for the universal: that pain of trying to hold onto something already flickering out. Such a complex feeling is hard to transcribe in music. OGGY does it with relative ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2021, she’s been building her world through gigs at Dalston’s Mustache Bar, endless open mics, self-driven promotion, radio interviews, and blog features. And now, “Another Dream” is the next step.  A sign of an artist who&#8217;s put in the hours, and an artist who is about to get the respect she deserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stream &#8220;Another Dream&#8221; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1nMRro0Y0pcSoFrdGQrDp0?si=ec05134876f84d61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/oggy-steps-into-her-own-light-with-another-dream/\">OGGY Steps Into Her Own Light with &#8220;Another Dream&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The best festival backpacks keep your water cold, your valuables protected, and your shoulders comfortable. Look for at least a 2 liter hydration capacity, insulation, anti-theft compartments that rest against your back, and padded straps for comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RaveRunner</a> has a number of <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hydration packs</a> that stand out for combining both functionality and design, making them one of the go-to sources for seasoned attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-theft design</strong>: The safest packs keep the main compartment against your back, making it nearly impossible for anyone to access while you’re dancing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration capacity</strong>: At minimum, you should look for a two-liter hydration pack so you can stay hydrated without constant refills that keep you off the dance floor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insulated or cooler-lined compartments</strong> so your drinks stay refreshing even after hours in the sun.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>All-day comfort</strong>: Padded straps, breathable materials, and balanced weight are non-negotiable when you’re wearing it from gates to afters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Festival-ready features</strong>: Bonus details like chest strap pockets give you a secure but easy-to-reach spot for valuables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Fanny Packs: Compact, Secure, and Versatile<br></strong>For instant access to your essentials on the dance floor, the hydration fanny pack is the perfect companion.

The result is a body of work made not for algorithms or DJ tools, but for people seeking energy and emotion. The album takes listeners on a journey through Andromedik’s full spectrum: from nostalgic nods <strong>(Nothing Like You)</strong> to high-energy anthems <strong>(Stone or Air)</strong>, emotional cuts <strong>(Feelings)</strong> and festival bangers<strong> (Sunlight)</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>Where my Rise EP set the tone, Ascension takes it all the way. This album shows who I truly am as an artist<br>– from emotional moments to pure club energy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wanted to prove that drum &amp; bass can have real songs – with hooks, melodies and feeling – and still go hard</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Andromedik (Axel Demarbaix)</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-high-profile-collabs-netsky-kanine-lauren-l-aimant-amp-more\">High-profile collabs: Netsky, Kanine, Lauren L’aimant &amp; more</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ascension features collaborations with some of Andromedik’s biggest inspirations and closest friends in the scene.

The lineup was curated by Andromedik himself, featuring <strong>Camo &amp; Krooked, Metrik, Emily Makis B2B Lens, Arcando</strong> and more. This edition also marked the world premiere of his new A/V show Ascension, designed to visually amplify key themes and moments from the album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stream/download <a href=\"https://andromedik.ffm.to/ascension-album\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/andromedik-triumphs-4500-tickets-gone-for-ascension-at-antwerp-expo/\">Andromedik Triumphs: 4,500 Tickets Gone for ‘Ascension’ at Antwerp Expo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

In 2024, she lit up the stage at&nbsp;<strong>Melodi Grand Prix</strong>, Norway’s national Eurovision finals, with her electrifying performance of&nbsp;<strong>“Woman Show”.</strong>&nbsp;With a decade of experience as one of Norway’s most sought-after live performers, Mathilde’s master’s degree in live performance sets her apart as a unique force on the club stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A songwriter from a young age, Mathilde began crafting pop songs at just nine years old, but her heart lies in&nbsp;<strong>EDM, house, and dance music</strong>. Her solo career launched in 2022, and she quickly amassed approximately&nbsp;<strong>70,000 monthly Spotify listeners</strong>&nbsp;with over&nbsp;<strong>3 million streams</strong>&nbsp;to date. Her previous releases have featured on influential editorial playlists such as&nbsp;<strong>New Music Daily (Apple Music), New Music Friday (Spotify in Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Finland), EQUAL Norway, and “Ny Pop.”</strong>&nbsp;Her single&nbsp;<strong>“Losing Game”</strong>&nbsp;has also been viewed over&nbsp;<strong>130,000 times on YouTube.</strong>&nbsp;Mathilde continues to expand her reach with collaborations across the globe, bringing her explosive energy and powerful vocals to the international club scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italian producer&nbsp;<strong>Ayko</strong>&nbsp;(Francesco Dogliani) brings his signature blend of&nbsp;<strong>melodic techno, house, and dance music</strong>&nbsp;to the collaboration. Drawing inspiration from 1980s British pop, Italo disco, and 1990s rave culture, Ayko has developed a sound defined by melodic depth, rhythmic complexity, and eclectic instrumentation. Beginning his career in Turin, Italy, Ayko has performed at legendary venues including&nbsp;<strong>Space, Sankeys, and Privilege in Ibiza</strong>. In 2021, he founded&nbsp;<strong>Langhewood Records</strong>, a UK-based independent label dedicated to original electronic music, which has become a platform for his releases and a nurturing ground for emerging artists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration is rounded out by&nbsp;<strong>George</strong>, an emerging electronic music artist whose deep house and melodic house sensibilities complement Mathilde’s powerful vocals and Ayko’s rich production, creating a track that promises to resonate on both festival stages and dance floors worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release of&nbsp;<strong>“Don’t Quit”</strong>&nbsp;is accompanied by a visually striking music video created using&nbsp;<strong>DREAMOTICA</strong>, the generative visual language developed by&nbsp;<strong>Emanuele Del Fio</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Viktoria Blank</strong>. Translating the song’s message of resilience into imagery, the video becomes a hypnotic fusion of light, motion, and emotion, where sound shapes color and form. Each frame is born from musical stimuli and digital artistry, achieving harmony between technology and human sensitivity. Through this collaboration,&nbsp;<strong>Langhewood Records</strong>&nbsp;and the DREAMOTICA team present a groundbreaking audiovisual experience that merges music, art, and introspection, pushing the boundaries of contemporary visual storytelling.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/mathilde-spz-joins-forces-with-ayko-and-george-to-release-their-new-single-dont-quit-on-langhewood-records/\">Mathilde SPZ joins forces with Ayko and George to release their new single “Don’t Quit” on Langhewood Records</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

Their music merges instrumental beats with contemporary club music. It tells a story about the mysterious arrival of large, breathing monoliths that create visions for those who approach them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Sarsen Cinema\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/61eoivoHYjg9iXiFGnrIlA?si=Hhab6FMITW6m08KA4YjaKQ&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-opal-drums-brings-out-mesmerizing-percussive-and-bass-sounds-that-draws-in-listeners-to-hear-more-of-sarsen-cinema\">Opal Drums brings out mesmerizing percussive and bass sounds that draws in listeners to hear more of <em>Sarsen Cinema</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the EP, Opal Drums combines rich sounds and catchy melodies with strong percussion and bass. This mix captures mixed feelings about the monoliths: fear, awe, devotion, and curiosity. The single &#8216;Burning Hammer&#8217; shows raw energy, while &#8216;Sunset Hex&#8217; goes deeper into hypnotic bass. Together, these songs introduce the world of <em>Sarsen Cinema</em>, where sound becomes vision and each rhythm tells part of a larger story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The title <em>Sarsen Cinema</em> highlights a connection between the ancient and the modern. &#8220;Sarsen&#8221; refers to the stone used in ancient monuments like Stonehenge, while &#8220;Cinema&#8221; represents storytelling and perspective. In this world, sound transforms into vision, and rhythm creates myths. The EP also includes additional tracks; the EP&#8217;s title track itself, <strong>&#8216;From The Grove&#8217;</strong>, <strong>&#8216;Ultraviolet&#8217;</strong>, and <strong>&#8216;Runes&#8217;</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-to-expect-from-the-duo-in-the-near-future\">What to expect from the duo in the near future</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Opal Drums blends both artists&#8217; styles and sees their process as a collaboration. They do not stick to one tempo or music genre. Instead, they create a unified sound that will lead to immersive live performances in 2026. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, <em>Sarsen Cinema</em> is more than just an EP. It serves as a portal into a sound that is both old and new, mechanical and human. This marks the beginning of the Opal Drums story.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-scaled.png\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-1024x1024.png\" alt=\"Sarsen Cinema EP Opal Drums\" class=\"wp-image-393185\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-300x300.png 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-150x150.png 150w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-768x768.png 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-2048x2048.png 2048w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-696x696.png 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-1068x1068.png 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-1920x1920.png 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sarsen-Cinema-Opal-Drums-420x420.png 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Image Courtesy: Opal Drums / Sarsen Cinema</figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/opal-drums-unveil-debut-ep-sarsen-cinema/\">Opal Drums Unveil Debut EP, &#8216;Sarsen Cinema&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>&#8216;<strong>Hey Son</strong>&#8216; is the studio chemistry collision of a track between New York melodic duo <strong>MC4D</strong>, Dutch mainstay <strong>Sam Feldt</strong>, German hit machine <strong>VIZE</strong>, and soul powerhouse <strong>Aloe Blacc</strong>. The track is a brass-laced, big-room-leaning house record built for wide-open mainstages and sunset slots. If you loved Avicii&#8217;s &#8216;Wake Me Up&#8217; you&#8217;ll love the bright and feel good track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core is Aloe Blacc’s unmistakable voice delivering the simple but effective hook: “Hey son, I wanna show you how this world is beautiful.” Layered over punchy drums, soaring synth stabs, and a massive horn section, the track radiates uplifting energy that you know from the 2013-2015 era with a modern punch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MC4D, the twin brothers stated: &#8216;<em>Hey Son&#8217; feels really special to us, not only because we’re collaborating with artists we’ve admired for a long time, but because the song captures the energetic music that got us into EDM in the first place. Aloe Blacc’s vocals and the powerful brass melodies create an energy that feels made for festival stages.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The massive track holds especially close to MC4D as they were first inspired to create music in 2013 after they heard &#8216;Wake Me Up&#8217; by Avicii and Aloe Blacc. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRN54UxjfFj/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Starting production at 12 and playing clubs by 14, he quickly rose from Liverpool newcomer to international standout. His early releases gained major DJ support and led to a viral Boiler Room debut at 16, followed by key signings with Teletech and standout tracks on Reckless, Taapion, HEKATE, and We Are The Brave. With major festival appearances and a debut album on the way, Farell champions the idea that age is no barrier to making an impact in electronic music.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-why-music\">Why music?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>⁠I’ve always listened to music religiously since I can remember.

I kind of gave up in school from the age of about 13.

This year’s lineup is stacked with both international heavyweights and local favorites, delivering a fiery soundtrack for the frigid months ahead. The opening weekend brings house-heavy headliners <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/?s=disco+lines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disco Lines</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/SOFI-TUKKER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOFI TUKKER</a>, and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/The-Blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Blaze</a>, setting the tone for another unforgettable season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each following weekend ups the ante with performances from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/DJ-Snake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Snake</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Madeon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Madeon</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Elderbrook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elderbrook</a>, Skull Machine — an explosive new bass project from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Black-Tiger-Sex-Machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black Tiger Sex Machine</a> and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Kai-Wachi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kai Wachi</a> – <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Max-Styler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Styler</a>, and a rare back-to-back set from techno queens, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Nicole-Moudaber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicole Moudaber</a> and Montréal’s own <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Misstress-Barbara\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Misstress Barbara</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Igloofest wouldn’t be Igloofest without showcasing the city’s thriving local scene. Collectives like Ferias and Homegrown Harvest return for stage takeovers, bringing the underground energy that defines Montréal’s dance music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Montréal wraps, the Igloofest tour heads across the country — touching down in Gatineau (February 12–14), Québec City (March 6–8), and making its first-ever appearance in Edmonton from March 13–15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contact.igloofest.ca/presale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pre-sale registration</a> opens November 6 at 11 a.m. ET, with general on-sale to follow November 7 via Igloofest’s official website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: Alexis Monet</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpEmAzEcH_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

His approach combines direct, functional production with personality, and this new release carries those same qualities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Patrick Topping</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chasewest/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a> / <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/chase_west\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Soundcloud</a> / <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4770WxUOyJMOJ1CHiZi2d6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spotify</a></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/12iWPV4rYVfR8RftPMZd4W?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>“All The DJs” centers around a focused arrangement that puts its rhythm section forward. The percussion drives the structure, the vocal line cuts through the mix, and the bass forms a steady foundation for peak club hours. Topping leans into a formula that highlights timing, contrast, and clarity, aiming for a track that performs reliably on large systems. The production style reflects his experience on international stages, where precision and impact matter as much as creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Timing Is Everything On This One</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The release also lands at a time when Solid Grooves continues to hold a key role in shaping the sound of clubs throughout Europe and beyond. For years the label has remained committed to a steady output built around strong dance floor identity and clear quality control. Inviting Topping onto the roster aligns naturally with that direction. The collaboration signals shared values around effective club music, consistency, and a commitment to pushing talent that connects strongly with crowds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For DJs, “All The DJs” offers a straightforward, useful record that fits into a wide range of sets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vocal hook adds personality without shifting attention away from the rhythm. The low-end translation feels tuned for modern systems, and the arrangement leaves enough space for layering, filtering, and live transitions. It reflects the kind of record built through real-world experience rather than trend chasing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Patrick Topping “All The DJs” dropped on Solid Grooves Records on 14 November 2025.</strong></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/all-the-djs-marks-a-new-chapter-for-patrick-topping/\">“All The DJs” Marks a New Chapter for Patrick Topping</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The UK-born, LA-based producer has spent the past twelve months unloading a steady run of singles that shaped charts and set the pace across the house scene.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7jhZ9ObYAmlHSoP6w6xB9g?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Tracks like ‘Stephanie’, ‘Not Gonna Be Your Boo’, and ‘X-Rated’ each had their moment, with ‘Stephanie’ holding Beatport’s top spot for six straight weeks during the early stretch of 2025. Every release added fuel to a year defined by heavy touring, strong club reactions, and a growing crowd of fans who connected with his approach to rhythm, vocal placement, and arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Vamos A La Playa’ pulls from the same energy he carried across the summer. The track was a fixture in his Ibiza sets, where it consistently worked in open-air environments. Its tight percussion and vocal hook shape the core of the record, while the groove keeps things light enough to work across a full range of set times. Cloonee leans into simplicity here, focusing on elements that translate well across large crowds. It’s the kind of track that fits into peak-time runs but also handles daytime stages without losing impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Snapshot of His 2025 Touring Year</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release also ties into a busy touring schedule. Cloonee spent the summer moving between Europe, North America, and key festival dates, keeping his sets centered around high-energy selections and strong crowd engagement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That run continues into the fall, and ‘Vamos A La Playa’ drops right before his Cloonee and Friends takeover at Miami’s Factory Town during Art Basel. He also has an Australia tour on the horizon, which adds another layer to what has already been a long year of travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each tour cycle has continued to feed into his releases, shaping how he tests new ideas and how he refines records before they reach streaming platforms. ‘Vamos A La Playa’ follows that pattern, arriving after months of real-world play and adjustments based on crowd response.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Solid Closing Statement for 2025</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With another headline moment on the way and a full release schedule building behind the scenes, this single acts as a clean close to 2025. Cloonee has built a strong year through consistent output, tight club records, and a touring schedule that allowed each track to find its place. ‘Vamos A La Playa’ continues that rhythm and sets him up well for whatever he decides to roll out next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Vamos A La Playa’ featuring Miranda dropped November 14 on Hellbent Records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/cloonee-closes-out-2025-with-vamos-a-la-playa-on-hellbent-records/\">Cloonee Closes Out 2025 with ‘Vamos A La Playa’ on Hellbent Records</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

From the very start, he has blended the raw energy of ‘90s raves with a futuristic vision, merging old-school synths and acid textures to craft a style that is unmistakably his own. His breakthrough came in 2019 with Future Legacy, a track that immediately caught the attention of techno and neorave enthusiasts. A year later, in 2020, he solidified his reputation with Demonic Dimension, a standout piece from the Possession project, which quickly became an essential anthem in the underground club scene. His productions, infused with cyberpunk aesthetics and the dystopian essence of Akira and Evangelion, immerse his audience in a world where past and future collide. Always pushing sonic boundaries, In 2023, Pawlowski signed a publishing deal with the prestigious KNTXT label, releasing Final Outsider, an EP that marked a new artistic chapter. In October 2024, he returned with Back with Another One, a collaboration with Fenrick, further cementing his status as a forward thinking artist. For eight years, his scarf was his signature, an enigmatic symbol inseparable from his persona. But in 2025, he chose to reveal himself, ushering in a new era in his career. This transformation was marked by a new EP with Fenrick, featuring Donne-moi le Tempo (Remix) by DJ Fou, a tribute to French club culture and his passion for genre blending. He also released Now is the Time with Johannes Schuster, further expanding his sonic horizons. From the shadows to the spotlight, Pawlowski continues to write his own legend.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/get-ready-to-sweat-byorn-pawlowskis-la-temperatura/\">Get ready to sweat: BYORN &amp; Pawlowski’s ‘LA TEMPERATURA’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

Fresh off a globe-spanning triumph that saw them command stages across four continents, the Grammy-winning trio is setting their sights on eight massive venues throughout Europe in Spring 2026, with British producer <strong>SG Lewis</strong> joining them for what promises to be an unforgettable sonic journey.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This isn&#8217;t just another tour announcement—it&#8217;s a statement. The band will take over London&#8217;s iconic O2 Arena, marking their largest UK headline show to date, and claim Amsterdam&#8217;s legendary <strong>Ziggo Dome</strong>, one of Europe&#8217;s most celebrated indoor venues. They&#8217;ll also make their mark at venues steeped in Olympic history, including Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>Palau Sant Jordi</strong> and Paris&#8217; <strong>Adidas Arena</strong>, while bringing their immersive live experience to Madrid, Zurich, Berlin, and Brussels. The inclusion of SG Lewis as support reflects the band&#8217;s commitment to curating every moment of the evening, ensuring fans are captivated from the instant they walk through the doors.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The numbers tell their own story. The trio&#8217;s <strong>Inhale / Exhale World Tour</strong> has already moved over 700,000 tickets across North America, South America, Europe, and Australia, cementing their status as titans of the live electronic music scene. Their most recent European run saw instant sellouts of back-to-back nights at Barcelona&#8217;s <strong>Plaza Mayor at Poble Espanyol</strong>, Berlin&#8217;s <strong>Uber Eats Music Hall</strong>, and Amsterdam&#8217;s <strong>AFAS Live</strong>, plus packed houses at Paris&#8217; <strong>Zénith</strong> and a triumphant headline slot at London&#8217;s <strong>Crystal Palace Park</strong>. Before they even touch down in Europe again, RÜFÜS DU SOL will storm through a dozen sold-out arena shows across their native Australia this fall, then ride that wave into South America for February and March dates spanning Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia—a direct response to overwhelming demand for their return.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>RÜFÜS DU SOL Tour Dates<br />New Dates in BOLD</strong><br />November 26 &#8211; Brisbane Entertainment Centre &#8211; Brisbane, AU (*) <br />November 29 &#8211; The Outer Fields at Western Springs &#8211; Auckland, NZ (*)<br />January 4 – Zamna – Tulum, MX (^)<br />February 19 – Movistar Arena – Buenos Aires, AR<br />February 22 – Movistar Arena – Santiago, CL<br />February 25 – Pedreira Paulo Leminsky – Curitiba, BR<br />February 27 – Mercado Livre Arena Pacaembu – São Paulo, BR<br />March 4 – Estadio Cincuentenario – Medellín, CO<br />March 6 – Coliseo MedPlus – Bogotá, CO<br /><strong>April 24 – Palau Sant Jordi – Barcelona, ES (*) | NEW<br />April 26 – WiZink Center – Madrid, ES (*) | NEW<br />April 29 – AG Hallenstadion – Zürich, CH (*) | NEW<br />May 1 – Velodrom – Berlin, DE (*) | NEW<br />May 3 – ING Arena – Brussels, BE (*) | NEW<br />May 6 – Ziggo Dome – Amsterdam, NE (*) | NEW<br />May 9 – Adidas Arena – Paris, FR (*) | NEW<br />May 13 – The O2 Arena – London, UK (*) | NEW</strong><br /><br /><em>* With Support from SG Lewis (Live)<br />^ DJ Set</em></p>\n",

Those records were part of my DJ sets and at-home listening: classic Verve jazz recordings flipped by modern electronic producers in a way that felt respectful, musical, and actually useful for DJs and selectors. They were my gateway back into the Verve catalog at a time when I was living almost entirely in house, broken beat, and downtempo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when Verve brought back the original <em>Verve Remixed</em> on that beautiful orange starburst vinyl, it felt like a proper moment. Naturally, I hoped that meant the rest of the series—and especially the holiday edition—would follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know that holiday music is fun at first, but it can start to get really stale really fast. Good news, your boring holiday playlist is about to get a massive upgrade!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2025, Verve finally delivered with <a href=\"https://store.ververecords.com/products/various-artists-verve-remixed-holiday-crystal-clear-lp?srsltid=AfmBOore1rufVKsNmjcr6daCjypDVvaoZnSGI-hi-X5Cx1EhptBzT4v6\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://store.ververecords.com/products/various-artists-verve-remixed-holiday-crystal-clear-lp?srsltid=AfmBOore1rufVKsNmjcr6daCjypDVvaoZnSGI-hi-X5Cx1EhptBzT4v6\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Verve Remixed Holiday,</a> a refreshed take on the 2008 Verve Remixed Christmas release. It&#8217;s not just a repress; it&#8217;s a curated hybrid—five classic remixes from the original CD plus five brand-new remixes from a new wave of producers like Ginton, Bolden, Tourist, Two Another, and DARGZ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for anyone into holiday vinyl, Christmas jazz remixes, or jazz-inspired electronic music, this one absolutely belongs in the crate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A Look Back: The Original <em>Verve Remixed Christmas</em> (2008)</strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignleft size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"320\" height=\"289\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/verve-remixed-A.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82557\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/verve-remixed-A.jpg 320w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/verve-remixed-A-300x271.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The 2008 <strong>Verve Remixed Christmas</strong> CD was one of the strongest seasonal projects of its time.

Both.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a holiday jazz remix album, this thing hits a sweet spot. The sequencing works both as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A front-to-back listen while you&#8217;re decorating, cooking, or hosting, and</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A DJ-friendly source of seasonal curveballs that won&#8217;t clear the floor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The newer cuts—especially the Bolden., Two Another, Tourist, Ginton, and DARGZ remixes—bring a little more texture and rhythmic modernity without going over the top. You&#8217;re still hearing Nina, Ella, Billie, Louis, Dinah, Shirley, Mel—but now in a context that fits neatly into a late-night jazz bar set or a sophisticated cocktail playlist.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Vinyl Pressing &amp; Sound Quality</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Verve Remixed Holiday comes pressed on crystal clear vinyl, the LP feels like a proper object, and these little touches add to the conversation when pulling it out of the sleeve, and collectors love it. Verve clearly understands that the overlap between jazz heads, electronic fans, and vinyl collectors is real; this pressing is good, with a warm midrange and solid low-end presence. You will hear artifacts from the original material, especially when listening on a nicer system, but that&#8217;s to be expected. If you throw an old jazz record, don&#8217;t expect it to have the sonic clarity of modern music, but instead a bit of that texture or old school stereo separation that makes those old records distinct and fun to listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The remixes are detailed but not hyper-compressed, which is crucial for this kind of material. The classic performances breathe, the room tone is still there, and the electronic elements sit around the vocals rather than bulldozing them, for the most part anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Standout Tracks</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Verve Remixed Holiday album doesn&#8217;t rely on any mediocre filler; it&#8217;s all very well done. Here are my favorite cuts though. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Nina Simone – &#8220;Chilly Winds Don&#8217;t Blow&#8221; (Bolden. Remix) -A perfect mission statement for the album—moody, modern, but still all about Nina&#8217;s vocal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ella Fitzgerald – &#8220;What Are You Doing New Year&#8217;s Eve?&#8221; (Two Another Remix) &#8211; Smooth, contemporary, and tailor-made for holiday playlists that skew more cocktail bar than shopping mall. If you don&#8217;t get some props on this one, you need new friends. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mel Tormé – &#8220;The Christmas Song&#8221; (DARGZ Remix) &#8211; One of the most overplayed holiday standards on earth, somehow rendered fresh again with smart, restrained production.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ella Fitzgerald – &#8220;We Three Kings&#8221; (Tourist Remix) &#8211; This one feels like it could live in a downtempo or nu-jazz set year-round, not just in December.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These tracks are where Verve Remixed Holiday really earns its spot alongside the original series and other best holiday vinyl records in rotation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Thoughts on Verve Remixed Holiday</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who&#8217;s been championing the Verve Remixed series for years, I&#8217;m honestly happy with how Verve Remixed Holiday turned out. It&#8217;s not a lazy repress or a gimmicky cash grab—it&#8217;s a thoughtful, 2025-ready evolution of Verve Remixed Christmas, with enough new material to justify the buy even if you own the original CD. Personally I&#8217;m biased towards the vinyl format, especially for holiday parties as the music becomes interactive and a conversation, not an afterthought or background music. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is going to be heavy rotation holiday listening for me—and I&#8217;m sure many others, as there is a true shortage of cool holiday albums out there and one can only take so much Bing Crosby. And more importantly, it gives me hope that we&#8217;ll see more Verve Remixed titles back on wax, maybe even a brand-new installment built specifically for this era. Welcome back, Verve Remixed. I&#8217;ve missed you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/verve-remixed-holiday-review/\">Verve Remixed Holiday &#8211; An Amazing Refresh from the Verve Remixed Series Just In Time For the Holidays</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

Enter DJing and bass music. It made for an easy segue, and the larger-than-life <strong>DJ Diesel </strong>is now hosting the largest bass festival in Texas. <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/shaqs-bass-all-stars/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"26006\">SHAQ’s Bass All-Star Festival</a></strong> is set to land in the <strong>Dallas-Fort Worth</strong> area at <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/panther-island-pavilion/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"26341\">Panther Island Pavilion</a></strong> on <strong>Saturday, March 21</strong>, for an insane day of epic bass, interactive brand activations, and even more pyrotechnics, making it the craziest edition yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big man himself curates SHAQ’s Bass All-Stars. A community-driven event, it features top-tier and up-and-coming bass talent hand-picked by SHAQ.  They’ll take over the <strong>Main Stage</strong> and <strong>Trenches </strong>stages, the latter of which is a SHAQ innovation. It’s a 360-degree stage that puts fans directly in the thick of things. No sidelines, no separation.

His pulsating trap and dubstep heaters will rattle bones only the way he can, spanning original tracks, remixes, and well-known beats.

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation. His &#8220;One Sound, Two Sides&#8221; philosophy translates into production that feels equally at home during peak-time festival moments and those rare club instances when everyone actually connects with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What separates this from typical progressive fare is TR3AL&#8217;s stated ambition beyond the booth. He&#8217;s developing a fully immersive live show incorporating visuals and motion-capture characters, treating each release as a narrative chapter rather than isolated singles. That cinematic storytelling approach is already evident in &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; &#8211; the track builds with genuine dramatic arc rather than just hitting familiar progressive house checkpoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a debut album and live show planned for 2026, TR3AL&#8217;s positioning himself as more than another festival circuit DJ. &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; captures what he describes as &#8220;the rush of energy you feel when you&#8217;re fully present&#8221; &#8211; ambitious conceptual framework aside, the track simply works as both emotional statement and dancefloor weapon. That balance is harder to achieve than it sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6CtNFlZYtifblpZy7SGASX?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/tr3al-gets-into-the-feels-on-never-ending-love/\">TR3AL gets into the feels on &#8216;Never Ending Love&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

At each corner there are various food joints, amenities such as the Beauty Bar, and plenty of space to roam around. On the outer edges Headliners could find all the EDC essentials: info booths, merch tents, free water refills, and more! Light-up tunnels guide you into the colorful center of EDC and make for a great meeting spot with friends.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for a Wonderful EDC Las Vegas 2021!</h2>\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic was, and still is in many ways, a difficult time for everyone, but we are infinitely grateful to have been able to reunite with our Headliners this year Under The Electric Sky.

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

Glassio&#8217;s highly anticipated new album <em>The Imposter </em>is set for release February 25th, 2026. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Glassio has <strong>garnered 25 million streams and his music has received placements in Netflix and HBO series.</strong> His music has received praise from the likes of <strong>FADER, NYLON, FLOOD, Wonderland and Consequence among others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Glassio - When The Beat Carries On (Official Visualizer)\" width=\"780\" height=\"439\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2TOfNmGsio?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Glassio’s third album,&nbsp;<em>The Imposter</em>, is a luminous meditation on identity, doubt, and the quiet act of returning to oneself. Written after a transatlantic move from New York to London and in the wake of newfound sobriety, the record unfolds as a self-portrait in motion — a dream-pop opus about shedding illusion and rediscovering purpose in creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across its 13 tracks, Glassio (Sam R.) weaves together elements of shoegaze, early-2000s electronica, and psychedelic folk, creating a sonic world where memory and melody drift in tandem. The album moves like a lucid dream — opening in disorientation (“Join the Club,” “Give Me Back My Future”), spiraling through moments of self-doubt and longing (“I’m So Far Away,” “Downtown Hero”), and ultimately arriving in grace and acceptance with the closing track, “Take a Look at the Flowers” — a radiant collaboration with avant-pop artist Madge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That song became my way of ending the loop,” Sam explains. “After all the searching, it’s just about stopping for a second — seeing what’s still blooming around you. It’s the record’s exhale.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, <em>The Imposter</em> asks a question that has haunted artists for generations: <em>If you were denied the right to create, would you still know who you are?</em> This inquiry surfaces most directly on “Hit or Bliss,” a spoken reflection that reframes the classic Rilkean test of creation as survival. The album doesn’t offer easy answers — instead, it finds beauty in uncertainty, empathy in imperfection, and purpose in the impulse to keep making.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“For a time, I lost my sense of self,” Sam admits. “I’d been performing roles — for people, for the industry, for an idea of who I thought I was supposed to be. This album was me stripping all that away and finding the real voice underneath.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the pulsing nostalgia of “Heartstrings” to the spectral shimmer of “Al Pacino” and the introspective haze of “I’m So Far Away,” each track feels like a page from an artist’s internal dialogue — by turns playful, melancholic, and transcendent. Even the most outward-facing songs hum with inner reckoning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Single &#8220;When The Beat Carries On&#8221; is a&nbsp;driving, nostalgic anthem,&nbsp;a dream-pop journey through illusion, identity, and rebirth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Glassio’s earlier work drew comparisons to the escapist bliss of acts like Hot Chip and M83,&nbsp;<em>The Imposter</em>&nbsp;inhabits a more vulnerable register — one where self-awareness replaces spectacle, and the line between persona and person begins to blur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a record born from confrontation: with addiction, with artistic doubt, with the quiet fear of being forgotten. But in the end,&nbsp;<em>The Imposter</em>&nbsp;offers a different kind of faith — the faith that what’s real can’t be performed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A maker makes,” Sam says. “That’s what they are. I had to stop running from that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time “Take a Look at the Flowers” closes the record, the tension has softened. What began as a battle with identity ends in a gentle realization: the self was never lost — it was waiting beneath the noise all along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://ellamaymorrison.lmailroute.net/x/d?c=48570952&amp;l=8ea2bd13-8f14-4afe-b0c5-aa52b2e15fcd&amp;r=c53fa124-14f3-4ab6-9e45-70bd0d515185\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SPOTIFY</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://ellamaymorrison.lmailroute.net/x/d?c=48570952&amp;l=baceff59-5d1d-43ac-bc52-618fc6035337&amp;r=c53fa124-14f3-4ab6-9e45-70bd0d515185\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">INSTAGRAM</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://ellamaymorrison.lmailroute.net/x/d?c=48570952&amp;l=151868fc-1459-4879-953d-d7f614b60c3b&amp;r=c53fa124-14f3-4ab6-9e45-70bd0d515185\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YOUTUBE&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/glassio-releases-new-single-when-the-beat-carries-on/\">Glassio releases new single &#8220;When The Beat Carries On&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

With longtime collaborator&nbsp;<strong>Victor Wiercioch</strong>&nbsp;capturing the session on film, the video offers an unfiltered look at a band connected by decades of friendship and shared purpose. “Being so emotionally connected to the way the song originated, we decided to try and capture that initial spark of inspiration on the record,”&nbsp;<strong>Miles</strong>&nbsp;explains. “We set up a few mics and got the whole thing down in one live take.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of&nbsp;<strong><em>Reprieve</em></strong>’s most poignant moments, “<strong>Rocking Chair</strong>” distills the spirit of the record: confronting change, loss, and the passage of time without losing sight of the light.&nbsp;<strong>The Penske File</strong>&nbsp;have long made their name on high-energy punk rock anthems, but here, they lean into restraint – offering a moment of quiet beauty amid the chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across its 12 tracks,&nbsp;<strong><em>Reprieve</em></strong>&nbsp;dives deep into themes of transition, aging, and resilience, but always circles back to connection. “This album is about holding on to the light in your life – chasing dreams and holding onto the ones you love, celebrating moments that are worth celebrating; laughing in the face of sadness, hardship and death,”&nbsp;<strong>Miles</strong>&nbsp;says. “It&#8217;s about cutting through the heavy noise of existence in this world and finding moments of reprieve that make life worth living.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/hamilton-ons-the-penske-file-deliver-intimate-live-video-for-rocking-chairs-from-new-album-reprieve/\">Hamilton, ON’s The Penske File Deliver Intimate Live Video for “Rocking Chairs” from New Album ‘Reprieve’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

A former touring drummer turned songwriter, Logan had been active in the music scene until  2009 when the band broke up, he felt the rug pulled out from under him. Add a young family to the  mix, and drumming was sidelined.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the pandemic of 2020 pulled him back. Like many people, Logan struggled with the isolation  and weight of uncertainty during this time: he needed a creative outlet. Picking up the guitar, he  found salvation in the daily ritual of creating music and bringing the sounds in his head out into the  world. Rough riffs became loops, layers, then full compositions. Slowly, Sounds Escape emerged.  Combining storytelling with musicianship, Sounds Escape crafts immersive instrumental narratives  that evoke powerful emotions. Sometimes it’s a single guitar line leading the way; sometimes it’s  forty instruments stacked together. <strong>It’s always led by feeling </strong>– music that invites you to step inside and lose yourself. Whether it’s a late-night headphone listen, a rainy Sunday soundtrack, or the  emotional undercurrent of a film scene, Sounds Escape offers tension and release, light and shade.  Logan’s works are compositions more than songs, adventures more than arrangements – where  listeners can find their own meaning and connection where they need it most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Exploding Stars’ is the perfect starting point for any listener, as it captures the ambitiously rewarding style of Sounds Escape and ‘Electric Love’ within its runtime. ‘Exploding Stars’ is also only a small taste of what you can expect from ‘Electric Love’ overall, which is an absolute  rollercoaster of rhythm, sound, and maybe most importantly, emotion. <strong>Instrumental music is a beautiful genre of music, and Sounds Escape is already a standout within that very style.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>‘Exploding Stars’ and ‘Electric Love’ will be&nbsp; available via streaming platforms on December 1</strong><strong><sup>st</sup></strong><strong>!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/loganwedgwood/?hl=en\">INSTAGRAM </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/intl-tr/artist/72GMAxaVblZ8Ug0qyHYo4x\">SPOTIFY </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/artist/sounds-escape/1614993366\">APPLE MUSIC </a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://soundsescape.com/\">WEBSITE</a> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/logan-wedgwood-returns-with-his-instrumental-outlet-sounds-escape-to-unleash-his-stunning-new-album-electric-love/\">Logan Wedgwood returns with his instrumental outlet  SOUNDS ESCAPE, to unleash his stunning new album ‘Electric Love’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

Blending soulful vocals with plaintive alt-country textures, &#8220;<strong>Bloom</strong>&#8221;&nbsp;is a deeply human exploration of honesty, imperfection, and the quiet courage it takes to face oneself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born out of a writing exercise with one of her students, &#8220;<strong>Bloom</strong>&#8221; evolved from a simple lyrical prompt into a stirring collaboration with longtime creative partner&nbsp;<strong>Sean Cronin</strong>. The track was recorded live to tape in a barn in Catskill, NY, with&nbsp;<strong>Cronin&nbsp;</strong>assembling an all-star ensemble of collaborators, including&nbsp;<strong>Noah B. Harley</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Spirit Family Reunion</strong>),&nbsp;<strong>Andy Weaver</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Adam Brisbin</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Big Thief</strong>), and&nbsp;<strong>Alex P. Wernquest</strong>&nbsp;(recording engineer and owner of&nbsp;<strong>Basement Floods Records</strong>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Creelman</strong>&nbsp;later overdubbed her vocals in Vancouver with&nbsp;<strong>Dave Genn</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>54-40</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Good Band</strong>) and&nbsp;<strong>Kendel Carson</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>Alan Thomas Doyle</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Shania Twain</strong>), whose fiddle and harmonies add depth and shimmer to the track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Stream &#8220;<strong>Bloom</strong>&#8221; now: <a href=\"https://found.ee/debrajeancreelman-bloom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://found.ee/debrajeancreelman-bloom</a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Bloom\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/250rDq4Nt802fdfXDCHCTV?si=zUVld-RCRRanw6DRHIPHxQ&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal was to make something soulful that properly reflected my biggest musical influences and had my vocals front and centre,&#8221;&nbsp;<strong>Creelman</strong>&nbsp;shares. &#8220;I wanted it to be something that would translate well live – more of an emotional experience for the listener rather than a cerebral one.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At once intimate and revelatory, &#8220;<strong>Bloom</strong>&#8221; finds&nbsp;<strong>Creelman</strong>&nbsp;at her most honest – wistful yet grounded, with a delivery that feels timeless and true. It&#8217;s the first glimpse into her forthcoming album,&nbsp;<strong><em>Little Town</em></strong>&nbsp;(out&nbsp;<strong>December 5th</strong>), that flows between genres effortlessly – with her distinct vocals, and&nbsp;<strong>Cronin</strong>&#8216;s cinematic storytelling as the thru line throughout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recorded across Galiano Island and Catskill, NY, and tracked live to analog tape at&nbsp;<strong>Basement Floods Records</strong>,&nbsp;<em><strong>Little Town</strong></em>&nbsp;exudes warmth, texture, and soul. From the janky rocker &#8220;Bing Bong Baby&#8221; to the sweeping title track and the radiant harmonies of &#8220;<strong>Bloom</strong>,&#8221;&nbsp;<strong>Creelman</strong>&nbsp;emerges fully in her power – free, fearless, and gloriously herself.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/vancouver-artist-debra-jean-creelman-marries-soul-and-alt-country-on-captivating-new-single-bloom/\">Vancouver Artist Debra-Jean Creelman Marries Soul and Alt-Country on Captivating New Single &#8220;Bloom&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

It also signaled the start of a new era for an artist who had already carved out a strong identity on some of the world’s most respected stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4gcM6IrzBWvPXQBPjkrjy1?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A New Home for ABEL’s Creative Direction</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The rollout of Laundry Label followed an intimate Mixmag Lab session during ADE inside Amsterdam’s Powders Laundrette. The setting captured the essence of what ABEL wanted to build. The layout encouraged movement, color, and close interaction, creating a mood that aligned with the direction of the new label. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The debut single reflected the same intention. “Slow Steady” leaned into a hypnotic and groove-focused approach with a structure built around flow and steady forward drive. It balanced tension, vocal presence, and minimal melodic detail in a way that kept attention centered on the movement of the rhythm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ABEL also used this moment to outline Laundry Label’s wider purpose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She wanted a platform that supported upcoming artists while giving them space to explore new ideas in unconventional environments. Her own experience shaped this direction. She had performed at fabric, DRUMSHEDS, Zamna Tulum, Hï Ibiza, Glastonbury, and other major venues, and she had shared lineups with names like Pete Tong, Damian Lazarus, and Camelphat. These experiences reinforced her belief in community-driven spaces that encourage personal identity to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Sound Behind “Slow Steady”</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Slow Steady” served as a clear introduction to ABEL’s vision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The record worked in peak hours and in slower, more controlled parts of a set. The rhythm locked into a steady pulse, the vocals sat with intention, and the production carried a patient sense of movement that fit her established style. The track also provided a preview of the tone listeners could expect from the label moving forward. ABEL’s catalog on Circus Recordings, Bedrock, DFTD, Nervous Recordings, and All Day I Dream had already shown her ability to shape hypnotic and effective club material. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Laundry Label gave her room to expand that range with more creative control and more experimentation.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/abel-launches-laundry-label-with-slow-steady/\">ABEL Launches Laundry Label with “Slow Steady”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

That moment where you’re supposed to “just write something” is exactly where most ideas lose steam. Not so much because you’re necessarily out of inspiration, but more so because starting from zero is way harder than anyone admits (it&#8217;s that whole blank-canvas syndrome thing)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to skip that weird creative limbo is to begin with something that already works: a chord progression that’s been powering some of the biggest hit records since the dawn of musical time (&#8230; or at least longer than most of us have been alive). <a href=\"https://blog.native-instruments.com/common-chord-progressions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Native Instruments actually covered the ten most famous chord progressions a while ago, and reading that article is actually what inspired me to get this one going</a>! When you anchor your loop to  tried and true chord progressions that naturally feel good to listeners, everything else becomes easier: melodies, basslines, rhythms, textures, transitions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole track starts growing on its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This guide is basically a blueprint for that workflow. If you want your loops to hit faster, feel catchier, and translate across genres, the starting point matters. So let’s build the loop that pulls listeners in before they even realize they’ve stopped scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-familiar-progressions-help-you-move-faster\"><strong>Why Tried and True Chord Progressions Help You Move Faster</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"510\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.51.37-PM-1024x510.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82719\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.51.37-PM-1024x510.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.51.37-PM-300x149.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.51.37-PM-768x383.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.51.37-PM.jpg 1389w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Sub Focus is one of my favorite artists, cause he brings a ton of harmonic magic to his drum &amp; bass releases. Here&#8217;s a pic of him playing at ARC this year </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain progressions show up across genres because the intervals feel natural to listeners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without understanding theory, people gravitate toward these patterns because the movement between chords creates emotion in a reliable way and the way that chord progression can uplift our emotions, pull them down, or suspend them with a sense of faux anticipation. When you start your loop with a familiar harmonic shape, your melody receives an immediate sense of direction and a framing which makes writing that melody all the more easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because a progression also gives your session structure. Without structure, every choice feels equally possible, which often slows creativity. Once harmony is present, rhythm and melody become easier to explore because your brain responds to the emotional cues inside the chords. The process feels more like shaping something that already exists rather than forcing an idea into place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why progressions play such an important role in melody writing. They support instinct and give the session a tone that influences every choice you make from that moment forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"progressions-that-always-pull-their-weight\"><strong>Progressions That Always Pull Their Weight</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Producers return to a handful of progressions because these harmonic shapes consistently activate creative ideas. They help melodies fall into place, encourage expressive basslines, and guide the overall tone of the loop. Roman numerals also simplify everything because you can shift the shapes into any key without slowing down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you understand how the intervals behave, you can move freely while keeping the progression intact. So let&#8217;s talk about some of the most classic progressions in the game, with some of the most popular tracks using those chord progressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-v-vi-iv\">I V vi IV</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The I V vi IV pattern brings a sense of uplift that works in house, pop, <a href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2023/07/free-melodic-techno-samples/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpil-monitor-id=\"6382\">melodic techno</a>, indie, and many other styles. The movement from the tonic into the dominant offers a sense of strength, and that strength often becomes the emotional anchor for your melody. Producers enjoy this pattern because it works for bright leads, gentle pads, rhythmic plucks, and everything in between. The shape feels familiar to listeners and encourages phrases that are easy to remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ovdm2yX4MA?si=ZUbpm3ecdEOvx1i_\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"vi-iv-i-v\">vi IV I V </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting with vi IV I V creates a reflective and sensitive mood. This progression often inspires deeper or more intimate melodic lines because it begins in a minor space and rises into major colors. The feeling is thoughtful without leaning too heavy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many producers use this pattern when they want to explore warmer textures or cinematic layers. The movement supports atmospheric ideas and offers plenty of space for spacious pads, vocal chops, and slowly unfolding melodies.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1y6smkh6c-0?si=1fBYMTjVBwjBvAPs\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-vi-iv-v\">I vi IV V</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The I vi IV V pattern carries a smooth sense of motion that works well for loops that build over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The progression creates a constant cycle that feels comfortable to the ear, which makes it ideal for grooves that need extended development. Producers who create chord-driven music often rely on this pattern because it allows rhythmic layers to settle into place while the harmony keeps everything moving forward. It becomes a strong backbone for arpeggios, piano lines, and melodic leads.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qetW6R9Jxs4?si=FHK80w2ZIPuxvQcJ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"ii-v-i\">ii V I</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ii V I sequence from jazz delivers expressive movement and a well-defined sense of arrival. This progression creates lift and resolution, which encourages melodic phrases that feel intentional. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even simple ideas gain maturity when written over this shape. Electronic producers often use it to bring subtle sophistication into genres that thrive on repetition. The emotional clarity inside this pattern gives your loop a refined character without requiring complex arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGBhQbmPwH8?si=spSZ1SNzQn1j6asw\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"i-vii-vi-vii\">i VII VI VII </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The i VII VI VII pattern shapes darker and more grounded moods. This progression works well for deeper or atmospheric music that benefits from weight and texture. The repeating cycle helps create hypnotic patterns that suit slower tempos or evolving pads. Producers often discover that even minimal melodic ideas feel rich here because the harmony provides such a strong tonal identity. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This progression thrives when paired with long-decay synths, filtered percussion, or sustained bass layers.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1GxjzHm5us?si=PHh-Z3VgKyEj6nQ9\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these progressions can support an entire track. Once you choose a shape, you establish the emotional language of the loop. This becomes the foundation that guides your voicings, your melodies, and the rhythmic decisions that follow. The progression is not the final product. It is the creative backdrop that helps you discover the ideas your track needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"turning-a-progression-into-a-loop-with-character\"><strong>Turning A Classic Progression Into A Track</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you drop a progression into your DAW and start looping it, the session opens up. The chords give your mind something to respond to, and ideas tend to appear without far less friction, almost like bowling for strikes with the bumpers on instead of gutters; it just makes the processes safer, easier and more fun for all involved. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.33.21-PM-1024x296.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82703\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.33.21-PM-1024x296.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.33.21-PM-300x87.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.33.21-PM-768x222.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.33.21-PM-1536x444.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.33.21-PM-2048x592.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is simple. Commit to the progression. Let it loop long enough for your ear to absorb it. Once the harmony settles into the background, your creativity starts to rise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we move through the rest of the article, I&#8217;ll be working on a fresh idea of my own using the chord progression of the classic dance track &#8216;Move For Me&#8217; by Kaskade &amp; Deadmau5 (the original MIDI of which is shown above). In almost every situation, chord progressions cannot be copyrighted because they are considered fundamental building blocks of music with a limited number of combinations (probably why it&#8217;s also so effective for starting tracks with a chord progression; it&#8217;s the foundation!). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"296\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.34.06-PM-1024x296.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82704\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.34.06-PM-1024x296.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.34.06-PM-300x87.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.34.06-PM-768x222.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.34.06-PM-1536x444.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.34.06-PM-2048x592.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is going to be making some quick edits and elongating the chords so I get sustained notes instead of the pluck patterns that are so iconic about the track from which the progression is pulled, but that&#8217;s just the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way you voice the chords matters. Look at the overall architecture of how the notes move and see how the changes I made below bring a more descending motion to the progression? They&#8217;re the same notes, just the leading tones and the voicing modifications to create an entirely different sound different movement within the same progression. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"277\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.35.49-PM-1024x277.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82705\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.35.49-PM-1024x277.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.35.49-PM-300x81.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.35.49-PM-768x208.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.35.49-PM-1536x415.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.35.49-PM-2048x554.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A progression in its basic form may feel too straightforward. Changing the order of the notes or spreading them across octaves can shift the entire emotional tone. Inversions can soften transitions, while wider spacing creates a sense of openness. Even one altered note can pull the harmony in a new direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These small choices help define the personality of the loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.38.35-PM-1024x317.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82707\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.38.35-PM-1024x317.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.38.35-PM-300x93.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.38.35-PM-768x238.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.38.35-PM-1536x475.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.38.35-PM-2048x634.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A well-structured bassline supports the harmony and encourages melodies to form naturally. In the image above you can see that I copy and pasted the MIDI notes from the chords into the bass line channel, muted the notes and then unmuted <em>most</em> of the root notes. I say most because you may see that in a few choice chords, I actually used the non-root note of the chord, just to create a bit of excitement in how the bass would harmonize against the chords above it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I dropped the whole clip by an octave as well, just to ensure those notes are down in the sub-range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bass establishes the gravity of the progression, and that gravity influences where your melodic phrases want to land. You can keep the pattern simple because the role of the bass is to shape motion. When the bassline feels confident, the rest of the loop develops more easily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some genres, this could be 80% of the work done already (at least once we threw on some drums and a vocal texture or two). But I want to get a melody going as well, so let&#8217;s start talking about writing something that sticks in our listeners&#8217; ears. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"839\" height=\"794\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.44.54-PM.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82708\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.44.54-PM.png 839w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.44.54-PM-300x284.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.44.54-PM-768x727.png 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 839px) 100vw, 839px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Repeating the melody is important because repetition builds recognition. I usually start with a one or two-bar ostinato pattern that helps define the cadence, placement, and movement of the notes in my melody and then expand on that short ostinato until it&#8217;s got just the right amount of complexity and variation. I liked the movement and rythmn of the short 2-bar pattern above, so I extrapolated up on so that it stretched over the whole progression, with the notes changing in tandem with the chord changes (pulling up the MIDI notes on the chords as well can help make this super easy). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.47.02-PM-1024x326.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82709\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.47.02-PM-1024x326.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.47.02-PM-300x95.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.47.02-PM-768x244.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.47.02-PM-1536x488.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.47.02-PM-2048x651.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do this by adding slight timing shifts, raising a note, or altering the final phrase, creating interest without disrupting the overall feel. These minor changes add momentum and prevent the loop from becoming static.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"328\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.49.33-PM-1024x328.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82710\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.49.33-PM-1024x328.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.49.33-PM-300x96.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.49.33-PM-768x246.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.49.33-PM-1536x491.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.49.33-PM-2048x655.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Melodic textures add depth to this workflow as well. You&#8217;ll notice in bat 61 of the MIDI note above how I went a whole step above what the leading tone of the chord is playing. That slight dissonance breaks from what the listener is expecting, and can play with anticipation to create more emotional moments. Just don&#8217;t go overboard with that type of dissonance or else it will feel, well, dissonant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quiet countermelody, a soft pluck, a reversed tail, or a filtered pad can introduce subtle movement. These elements fill the space around the main melody and support the emotional tone of the loop without overwhelming it.

Rhythm can reshape the emotional effect of any harmonic pattern. Straight chords feel different from syncopated patterns or slower arpeggios. Even a simple shift in timing can change how the progression sits inside the groove, a move that&#8217;s super powerful when you&#8217;re producing music that relies on a 4&#215;4 kick pattern. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"280\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.58.23-PM-1024x280.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82711\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.58.23-PM-1024x280.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.58.23-PM-300x82.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.58.23-PM-768x210.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.58.23-PM-1536x419.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-2.58.23-PM-2048x559.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Noticee how the eight-bar loop I&#8217;ve been using has been duplicated and combined to form a single 16-bar progression and then the notes at the end of the loop&#8217;s second cycle have been drawn out more? That can create a sense of anticpation that draws the listener into the start of the loop again (plus it prevents there being more meldoic movement at the end of a larger 16-bar progression which means more attention can be drawn towards some melodic ear candy or drum fill which oftentimes fills that space as well). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Borrowed chords add a sense of color that pushes the harmony into new territory. This technique creates moments that feel unexpected but still natural. The melody often responds with richer shapes because the harmonic environment becomes more expressive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pedal tones create tension by holding one note steady while the rest of the harmony moves. This technique creates a hypnotic pull that works well for cinematic or minimal styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inversions also influence the emotional direction of a progression. Reordering the notes can create different degrees of lift or weight, which helps shape the loop without altering the progression itself. Melodies sometimes lead the harmony. When a melodic line suggests a new chord or pathway, follow it. These small deviations often become the most memorable moments in a track.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"turning-a-loop-into-a-track-without-losing-its-spark\"><strong>Turning a Loop Into a Track Without Losing Its Spark</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong loop contains everything you need to build a full arrangement. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.00.56-PM-1024x254.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82712\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.00.56-PM-1024x254.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.00.56-PM-300x74.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.00.56-PM-768x191.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.00.56-PM-1536x381.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.00.56-PM-2048x508.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin by stripping the loop down to its core. In the image above, which is used for the introduction and first verse of the track, I&#8217;ve cut all the leading tones and upper voicings of the chords so that the chords can still be felt and the warmth that the pads or piano playing the chords still fill out the midrange of the track, but they don&#8217;t really offer a &#8220;progression&#8221; just yet. Chords, bass, and one melodic idea can set the stage. Introduce new layers gradually so the energy rises in a natural way.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.05.21-PM-1024x287.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82713\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.05.21-PM-1024x287.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.05.21-PM-300x84.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.05.21-PM-768x216.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.05.21-PM-1536x431.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-3.05.21-PM.png 1657w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Allow quiet moments to create space for anticipation. Bring elements in slowly. Remove them when the track needs contrast. Save your heaviest variation for the final section so the track reaches a satisfying peak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automation keeps the loop alive. Small movements in brightness, filtering, pitch, or effects help the listener feel the track evolving. These subtle moments create life inside the arrangement without demanding constant new material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loop should feel like it grows and breathes throughout the track.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"why-this-workflow-feels-so-effective\"><strong>Why This Workflow Feels So Effective</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting your creative process with a time-tested progression helps every part of the track form more easily. Harmony gives direction to melody. Melody informs rhythm. Rhythm shapes energy. The session becomes a cycle where each idea inspires the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach removes pressure from the early stages and helps you move quickly toward sounds that feel authentic. Your ideas gain structure and emotional clarity because the progression sets the tone from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A progression does not decide the quality of your music. It simply holds the space where your creative instincts can unfold with more freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/tried-and-true-chord-progressions/\">Tried and True Chord Progressions: Use Time‑Tested Progressions for Instant Vibe</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

It is the newest version of their pitch tool and it has been rebuilt around speed, transparency and musical feel. <a href=\"https://www.synchroarts.com/repitch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The update brings a redesigned interface, multi track editing and an intelligent timing engine that understands phrasing instead of forcing rigid correction</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key features from the new release:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>SmartAttack, which detects transients and can snap notes toward the grid while respecting the natural groove</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Multi track editing, so you can view and tune multiple vocals in a single window instead of juggling separate instances</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A floating toolbar and improved note editing tools that keep the main controls close to your cursor</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As Patrick Bourget, VP Product at LANDR, put it, “We’ve rebuilt RePitch from the ground up to make vocal editing faster, easier, and more musical, a workflow that feels as natural as the results sound.” For anyone who tunes doubles all day or needs tight pop stacks without artifacts, that focus on feel is the important part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a deal perspective, RePitch 2 Standard is included in LANDR’s Super Plugin Bundle and Ultimate Plugin Bundle, alongside tools like VocAlign 6 and Revoice Pro 5, plus LANDR’s own Mastering Plugin, FX Suite, Guitar and Chromatic. Studio plans also include RePitch 2 Elements, so even subscribers who do not want to buy a perpetual bundle outright still get access to a streamlined version of the new engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which Black Friday route makes sense for you</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-8.28.29-AM-1024x753.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82686\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-8.28.29-AM-1024x753.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-8.28.29-AM-300x221.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-8.28.29-AM-768x565.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-20-at-8.28.29-AM.png 1310w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only care about vocal production and want permanent licenses, the Super Plugin Bundle at its Black Friday price is a clean move. You get RePitch 2 Standard, VocAlign 6 Standard, the LANDR Mastering Plugin SE and a focused set of FX and instruments, plus the two free partner plugins from the promotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a full environment to write, finish and release tracks, a discounted Studio Standard or Studio Pro plan is the better long-term value. You <a href=\"https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/30537672/www.landr.com?p=eyJzIjoiQ3JOc0l4eWNLUkU0UjZjS3NjRzV3aWVpVzRvIiwidiI6MiwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMDUzNzY3MixcInZcIjoyLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5sYW5kci5jb21cXFwvb25saW5lLWF1ZGlvLW1hc3RlcmluZ1wiLFwiaWRcIjpcImMyZDljMzA4YzRkMTQ5M2Y4YTRlMTFhMDAwMzNjYmRhXCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiNGQ4MjIxZGM5ODgwODE3MzY0Y2UwN2MwNDg0YmQ1NzM4ZDkyOTg3M1wiXSxcIm1zZ190c1wiOjE3NjM2NzQ1ODR9In0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">get unlimited mastering</a>, distribution, samples, collaboration tools, a library of plugins that includes RePitch 2 Elements, and a large stash of extra partner software.

Originally from rural Appalachia, he spent years honing his craft in the Baltimore scene before relocating to Northern California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His music blends elements of slow house, future garage, breakbeat and downtempo into immersive, emotionally rich soundscapes. Across more than two decades of work—both solo and in the duo Aligning Minds—he’s developed a deeply personal language of sound that resists easy categorisation.<br><br>His new EP, Truth Remains, finds him at a point of both reflection and forward motion. The tracks occupy that sweet spot between introspection and the dancefloor: drums that move you and moods that invite you to sit quietly with them. His writing process here starts with a groove he connects with, then builds emotional texture and atmosphere around it. Thematically, the EP contemplates what endures when illusion falls away—drawing from the social and cultural turbulence of recent times, as well as his own internal landscape. The result is music that feels worn, but hopeful. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Truth Remains\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6nemda3ddfSgVvgDzTOSTs?si=185542c04c3540af&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate the release, he’s crafted an exclusive mix for us, offering a wider lens into his world, bridging the EP’s themes with broader musical terrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check the mix and our interview with Daniel below. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-block-embed-soundcloud\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Magnetic Mix: A Path Untold by Magnetic Magazine\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F2215810580&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxheight=960&#038;maxwidth=640\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The new record sits in that space between introspective listening and physical movement. When you’re writing, do you tend to start from a place of internal mood, or from rhythm and motion in the body?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I usually start from a balance of both mindsets. I almost always start by making a drum groove that captivates me and creates a sense of forward momentum that I feel genuinely excited by. That becomes the rhythmic and energetic framework. From there, my goal is to complement it with an emotional mood that sets a specific theme or narrative, and can be propelled by those rhythmic, physical components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all about finding a striking balance between those elements, often guided by a “rule of three” approach &#8211; honing ideas down around three core essential components that provide contrasting yet harmonious qualities. I work pretty tirelessly until that union feels right, when groove, emotional impact and atmosphere all gel together in a satisfying way..</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There’s a sense in these tracks of something weathered but still hopeful, like memory being processed in real time. Was there a particular life shift or experience that shaped the emotional tone of the EP?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This EP was very honestly written as a way to process and focus on hope, amid the barrage of social, cultural, and political turmoil in America over this past year. I’d wake up to some chaotic headline, and while working on a deadline &#8211; I’d think, as a working artist, “It’s imperative to be at the top of my creative game right now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There wasn’t much room to just feel overwhelmed, I had to transmute that energy immediately. That sense of urgency &#8211; the pressure of time and creative drive forward forced me to dive deep into emotional expression quickly, without overthinking. It was challenging, but it sharpened me. It became a kind of “adversity-forges-the-blade” process that fueled a very potent and decisive creative flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emotionally, my perspective is always: How can I reflect the personal honesty of what I’m feeling and observing, yet still find hope and triumph within it for my own transmutative process? That’s what art does for me. I’m drawn to explorations of duality, like nostalgia and futurism, vulnerability and defiance &#8211; and I think that’s probably what shapes what you’re describing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does your life in Northern California inform the space and scale in your music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Life here is unlike anywhere else I’ve lived. It’s beautifully sunny almost every day &#8211; perfect weather, sometimes to a fault. I’m surrounded by stunning, varied nature: mountains, deserts, forests, the ocean. That diversity of ecosystems feels parallel to my own musical diversity, pulling from different genres, eras, and cultures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culturally, my town (Nevada City) is a little bit like if Burning Man were an actual town year-round &#8211; filled with creativity, self-expression and experimentation. That spirit of artistic freedom definitely seeps into the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your palette draws on breakbeat, garage, dub techno, and more, yet it never feels referential. How do you approach pulling from genres without leaning into nostalgia?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a genre wanderer and obsessive student of electronic music history, I’m deeply dedicated to studying what makes each form and aesthetic tick &#8211; the detailed mechanics that define them. I take in and incorporate that knowledge, technique and those sensibilities, but then I very deliberately step away from what I feel has already been done in those realms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, I treat genres as colors in my own personal crayon box. I try to tune everything else out &#8211; trends, expectations, conventions &#8211; and then just try and tell my own stories using those colors as honestly as I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always been an observer of genres and their respective culture without ever fully “belonging” to any one of them. That outsider perspective is just my natural mode of being, and I think that’s why the music hopefully feels distinct rather than derivative.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sun_hood.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82661\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sun_hood.jpg 1920w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sun_hood-225x300.jpg 225w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sun_hood-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sun_hood-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sun_hood-1536x2048.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The press notes mention exploring what remains when illusion falls away. How did this idea show up practically during the writing process?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With each body of work, I center on whatever concept feels most relevant in my life at that time. For Truth Remains, that concept was the conflict between falsehood and truth &#8211; how at the moment, American society struggles to agree on even the most basic shared realities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re often left dealing with fragments of the truth, but in the end, when everything else collapses, truth is always what endures &#8211; even if it sometimes takes quite a while to emerge. I loved the double-entendre, layered meaning of Truth Remains as a title, and that idea became the narrative compass for the writing process &#8211; almost like a personal sonic journal exploring that theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also shows up musically: in harmonic choices, textures, and particularly in “Corners of Vastness,” which lyrically ties into the concept. There’s a more developed vocal version of that track with a full lyrical structure that unfortunately couldn’t be released. But I kept enough of that essence in the released version to carry the message. It can be challenging conveying a more literal concept through mostly instrumental music, but I try to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There’s a strong textural presence across the EP, almost tactile. Are there specific recording or processing techniques you return to in order to achieve that grain and depth?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m definitely obsessed with texture and creating a tangible sense of space, of physicality in sound. I love how a single musical idea can feel entirely different depending on its textural nuances. Artists like old Boards Of Canada, Burial, Djrum, many more, etc &#8211; have all really been shining examples to me personally of what’s possible as far as that goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To achieve that, I’m constantly collecting unusual field recordings that I blend into my sound design, and I push synthesis and post-processing to add as much character and organic detail as possible. For example, in Ableton Live, I often build layered instrument chains &#8211; one synth might handle the tonal element, while another sample-based layer (like NI Straylight) contributes to pure atonal texture that compliments the expression of the idea in interesting ways. I’ll then fuse them together until they feel like a single unified sound entity.<br><br>That process extends to micro and macro levels &#8211; I spend large amounts of time injecting texture and detail into every element until it feels alive to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Truth-Remains-EP-.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82662\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Truth-Remains-EP-.jpg 1500w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Truth-Remains-EP--300x300.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Truth-Remains-EP--1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Truth-Remains-EP--150x150.jpg 150w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Truth-Remains-EP--768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The use of vocal textures feels expressive without relying on lyrical narrative. What draws you to voice-as-instrument rather than voice-as-statement?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always heard vocals primarily as melodic instruments (even in lyric-driven songs). The enunciation, tone, and phrasing tend to hit me first, long before the words themselves become apparent in my auditory awareness. The lyrics usually unfold for me only after numerous repeated listens &#8211; so, I’ve always found a lot of value in the interpretive nature of that approach, and at this point I’m just kind of conditioned that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when I include lyrics, I like to obscure them a bit &#8211; to make listeners work to uncover meaning rather than presenting it too literally. That interpretive space creates a sense of mystery that keeps me engaged as a listener and I try to replicate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tell us about the mix you&#8217;ve put together for us… any specific tracks you want to highlight?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well… I always try to aim for “all killer, no filler.” <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> But if I had to highlight a few, I’d say “Corners of Vastness” and “LoneFeather” are personal standouts.<br><br>“Corners of Vastness” captured a deep, ancient sort of energy I’d been chasing for a long time &#8211; something hypnotic that carries you through suspended emotional spaces. “LoneFeather” was a blast to make; I wanted to create a more high-energy breaky roller that balances haunting mystery with something uplifting and triumphant. I’m always drawn to tracks that embody intense duality, that can be both shadowy and radiant within a single narrative.<br>I also really value “Left To Wonder”, (opening track) which started as a film-scoring type of idea, that eventually blossomed into a gentle, dynamic slow-house/future garage track that underpinned those themes. That track was really an unexpected and unique journey to unravel. I think it’s a unique standout on the EP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve released three substantial EPs over the last few months. What’s driving that level of momentum right now, and how do you protect the emotional core of your work through that pace?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, really it’s a balance between having a lot to say and needing to sustain myself as an artist. All of this music is also available for sync licensing and I’ve been fortunate to have creative freedom within that framework &#8211; to make what I genuinely want to make.<br><br>At the same time, today’s industry pace demands a fairly constant output and I think most artists are really feeling that right now. In addition to that, over my 25 years of being a producer, I’ve long wanted to reach a level of prolific consistency that still maintains my vision and quality. Over the past two years, I’ve released more music per year than I’ve ever done so far… which has been both a personal and professional milestone.<br><br>Ultimately, it’s been about seeing if I could do it &#8211; write, finish, and release on deadlines without compromising emotional authenticity. It’s definitely felt like a creative leveling-up period, and I’m just following where that momentum wants to lead me next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Truth Remains EP is out now</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mix tracklist:<br>A Path Untold &#8211; Left To Wonder<br>Poriori &#8211; Stepping Stoned<br>James Shinra &#8211; Nosine (2025 Rework)<br>A Path Untold &#8211; Colors Of Love<br>Amyn &#8211; The Dream<br>A Path Untold &#8211; Corners Of Vastness<br>Gantz &#8211; Drop It<br>A Path Untold &#8211; In Mind<br>Sajge &#8211; Hesi<br>French II &#8211; Jolly Motto<br>A Path Untold &#8211; LoneFeather<br>A Path Untold &#8211; Ever We Drift<br>Stimming &#8211; Lucky Me<br>Verses GT &#8211; Unknown<br>Amyn &#8211; Happened<br>A Path Untold &#8211; Cloaked In Creation</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/magnetic-mix-a-path-untold/\">Magnetic Mix: A Path Untold</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The festival is slated to return to its home at <strong>Tinker Field </strong>on <strong>November 6-8, 2026</strong>, bringing a weekend-long experience filled with multiple stages of booming beats, top-tier production, and more. But if you want to punch your ticket at the lowest cost, you&#8217;ll want to act fast, as the Future Owl sale is set to kick off on <strong>November 21</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prices for three-day passes to the 2026 edition during the Future Owl sale start at $219.99 for GA, $299.99 for GA+, and $419.99 for VIP. Those who purchase GA+ receive access to expedited entry and access to premium, air-conditioned restroom trailers. VIP passholders gain additional access to exclusive areas to dance, special activities, gourmet food and beverage options, and more. All pass types are available on layaway for a $5 deposit at the time of purchase.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, those who purchase their passes during the Future Owl sale will receive first access to shuttle passes and premier parking when that goes on sale. Purchasers will also receive a 15% discount on online merchandise orders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like last year, <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/pasquale-rotella/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"42\">Pasquale Rotella</a></strong> posted on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQ7zNNnEpT_/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media</a> after the festival ended to address some of the comments stemming from this year&#8217;s edition. This included discussing the weather closure on Sunday, which led to congestion at certain stages and pathways throughout the festival. &#8220;While it was uncomfortable, it was a crowd flow issue, and not a surge or crush,&#8221; he stated in the post. &#8220;We had no medical incidents due to this, and it cleared quickly.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rotella also addressed the sole water station that was a major topic of conversation online over the weekend. He stated that at EDC Orlando and other festivals around the country, Insomniac has focused on having one large water station with more refill points rather than smaller ones that have caused congestion throughout the festival grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lineup for EDC Orlando will be revealed next year. The most recent iteration brought forth performances from the likes of Chris Lake, Sara Landry, Gorgon City, SVDDEN DEATH, Armin van Buuren, Porter Robinson, Excision, Subtronics, SOFI TUKKER, James Hype, Dom Dolla, Charlotte de Witte, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Three-day GA, GA+, and VIP passes for EDC Orlando 2026 go on sale Friday, November 21, at 11am ET, with all pass types available on layaway for a deposit down at the time of purchase.

The <strong>NDSM Docklands</strong> will once again become the beating heart of electronic music as DGTL celebrates its 14th edition from April 3-5, 2026. This iconic industrial site transforms into a futuristic playground where cutting-edge music collides with immersive art, all while pushing the boundaries of sustainability and community. The festival has just dropped its first wave of artist announcements, and it&#8217;s a mouth-watering mix of international heavyweights, innovative live acts, and the rising stars who are shaping tomorrow&#8217;s sound.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When Saturday April 4th rolls around, expect the energy levels to hit the ceiling. British duo<strong> Camelphat</strong> will be serving up their signature blend of progressive house and melodic techno—those euphoric build-ups and emotional crescendos that make dance floors come alive. Meanwhile, Manchester&#8217;s <strong>Interplanetary Criminal</strong> injects raw UK garage energy with sharp breaks and rhythms pulled straight from the city&#8217;s thriving underground scene. Over on the Modular Stage, <strong>Gotu Jim</strong> delivers a live performance that&#8217;s become legendary for fusing dark hip hop, house, and trap with splashes of hyper pop and emo house. His tracks capture that beautiful contradiction of nightlife—euphoric yet introspective, uplifting yet deeply emotional.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">DGTL favorite <strong>Jayda G</strong> makes her return, ready to light up the crowd with her irresistible fusion of disco, house, and funk. Beyond her infectious sound, she brings a message that resonates perfectly with DGTL&#8217;s ethos, including her powerful documentary <strong>Blue Carbon</strong>, which explores the intersection of music, science, and environmental awareness. The turntables will also see a special moment when <strong>Kamma</strong> and <strong>Yu Su</strong> join forces for their first-ever B2B set at DGTL—expect soulful grooves meeting cosmic house as Amsterdam&#8217;s flow intertwines with dreamy, textured soundscapes touched by subtle Chinese folk influences. And if you&#8217;re looking for something truly unforgettable, <strong>horsegiirL</strong>&#8216;s new audiovisual live show promises to blur the line between performance art and full-throttle rave, delivering an irreverent, surreal explosion of vocals, visuals, and hyperactive club energy.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Sunday April 5th brings the weekend to a spectacular close with a lineup that spans the entire electronic music spectrum. Fresh off his explosive ADE performance and that surprise pop-up rave at Amsterdam Central Station, Groningen&#8217;s <strong>Benwal</strong> returns with the unstoppable momentum that&#8217;s made him one of the Netherlands&#8217; fastest-rising stars. His sets are a high-octane blend of hard trance, rave, and house with contemporary twists that will leave you breathless. Grammy nominee <strong>Dom Dolla</strong> arrives with his crowd-pleasing house sound—groovy, powerful, and engineered for pure mass euphoria. On the more intense end,<strong> I Hate Models</strong> crafts emotional journeys through melancholic synthwave, trance, and industrial techno, creating that perfect fusion where raw aesthetics meet dance floor intensity.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Keep an eye on <strong>Odymel</strong>, whose eclectic mix of house, techno, trance, and eurodance has made him one of the scene&#8217;s most exciting new voices since his 2023 breakthrough. His melodies somehow feel both nostalgic and revolutionary at the same time. Berlin&#8217;s <strong>DJ Gigola</strong> brings her playful yet fierce approach, mixing techno, rap, and hyperpop into a uniquely infectious rave experience. Amsterdam&#8217;s own <strong>Luuk van Dijk</strong> delivers that recognizable warm, swinging house groove that keeps bodies moving, while <strong>Weval</strong> takes the stage with their cinematic live show that has evolved toward a more dancefloor-focused direction without losing any of that emotional depth and rich texture they&#8217;re known for.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"DGTL ADE 2025 | AFTERMOVIE\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkLTZrr22lA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n",

After his well-received full-length &#8220;Oktopus Mekaniks&#8221; established him in underground club circuits, this new release refines his unique approach &#8211; sampling his own acoustic drum kit, sequencing it digitally, and essentially creating a &#8220;shortcut between the computer and himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead single &#8220;Shortcut Jenny&#8221; perfectly demonstrates this hybrid POV. Built around hunting-horn samples (courtesy of a friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s obscure record) and VAAGUE&#8217;s own voice, the track evolved from a happy accident &#8211; a digital synth preset that accidentally dropped pitch became the massive bass drop that anchors the UK Garage groove. Jennifer Lawrence interview snippets provide texture without imposing meaning, letting listeners create their own narrative. It&#8217;s the kind of innovative production approach you&#8217;d expect from someone who spent years mastering jazz before diving into electronic music from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes VAAGUE&#8217;s trajectory compelling is how completely he&#8217;s committed to this electronic persona. Starting with downtempo experiments on his 2021 self-titled EP, collaborating with Le Motel on 2022&#8217;s dancefloor-focused &#8220;From the Ashes,&#8221; and now fully embracing faster tempos and live playability on &#8220;SHORTCUT,&#8221; he&#8217;s methodically building a unique sonic identity. His background as a jazz bandleader informs everything &#8211; the complex choreography of his live stick performances, the compositional sophistication underlying even his most club-ready tracks. &#8220;SHORTCUT&#8221; proves the detour through jazz was actually the most direct route to somewhere genuinely original.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2KfrQENbQ6yI3Hmiki9iKy?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/401707/\">VAAGUE Teases Boundary-pushing EP with Lead Single &#8216;Shortcut Jenny&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

For me, seeing the growth Sage (<a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=Devault\">Devault</a>) has made over the years has been nothing short of inspiring. From moody remixes that first caught fire online to commanding festival stages across the world, he’s carved his own lane—one defined by emotion, texture, and experience.</p>\n<p>Now, with “Feels Like Us,” released via John Summit’s commanding record label, Experts Only, Devault steps into a new era. The track blends nostalgic melodies with futuristic sound design. The chords keep you locked in, but the topline leaves us wanting more. It’s the kind of record that feels like late-night city lights and open highways, balancing introspection with release.</p>\n<p>Teased by John Summit at Experts Only Festival in NYC and Austin City Limits, the track has already stirred massive anticipation. Devault, known for drawing from Depeche Mode and Daft Punk, continues to refine his signature blend of dark energy and modern elegance—proving once again that emotion and innovation can coexist beautifully.</p>\n<p>“Feels Like Us” isn’t just another drop—it’s a statement.
