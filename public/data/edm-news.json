Having gear that balances style, comfort, and security is crucial. Here’s what every festivalgoer should know before stepping through the gates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Packs: The All-Day Essential</strong><br>A hydration pack isn’t just for storage, it’s survival gear for long days and late nights. The best festival backpacks keep your water cold, your valuables protected, and your shoulders comfortable. Look for at least a 2 liter hydration capacity, insulation, anti-theft compartments that rest against your back, and padded straps for comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RaveRunner</a> has a number of <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hydration packs</a> that stand out for combining both functionality and design, making them one of the go-to sources for seasoned attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-theft design</strong>: The safest packs keep the main compartment against your back, making it nearly impossible for anyone to access while you’re dancing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration capacity</strong>: At minimum, you should look for a two-liter hydration pack so you can stay hydrated without constant refills that keep you off the dance floor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insulated or cooler-lined compartments</strong> so your drinks stay refreshing even after hours in the sun.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>All-day comfort</strong>: Padded straps, breathable materials, and balanced weight are non-negotiable when you’re wearing it from gates to afters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Festival-ready features</strong>: Bonus details like chest strap pockets give you a secure but easy-to-reach spot for valuables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Fanny Packs: Compact, Secure, and Versatile<br></strong>For instant access to your essentials on the dance floor, the hydration fanny pack is the perfect companion. They keep critical items like your phone, ID, and keys securely zipped against your body without weighing you down. Prioritize durable materials, tight zippers, and adjustable straps that can be worn crossbody or around the waist. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/hydration-bag/hydration-crossbody-fanny-pack-rave\">RaveRunner’s hydration fanny packs</a> deliver the comfort, flexibility, and anti-theft features you need for a worry-free night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration fanny pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Durable materials </strong>that won’t rip or tear if someone tries to force their way in.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Secure zippers or buckles </strong>that stay closed even when you’re in the middle of the crowd.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Room for hydration: </strong>space to stash a water bottle or soft flask can make a big difference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comfy &amp; Outfit-friendly</strong>: Find a pack that matches any look and is versatile enough to wear crossbody, around the waist, or slung over the shoulder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clear Bags: Staying Festival-Compliant</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.musicfestivalwizard.com/festival-bag-policy-changes-theft-why-clear-hydration-packs-and-fanny-packs-are-a-must/\">Clear bag policies</a> are now the standard at most major festivals, but that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice utility. Look for transparent bags that meet policy sizing, include hidden pockets, and maintain comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/product/anti-theft-clear-fanny-pack?type=rave\">RaveRunner’s clear fanny packs</a> and <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/product/clear-backpack-hydro-backpack?type=rave\">clear hydration backpacks</a> let you breeze through the entrance, offering peace of mind and keeping you gate-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a clear festival bag:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Policy-approved sizing</strong> so you don’t get turned away at the gate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anti-theft details</strong> like hidden pockets and secure buckles, because clear doesn’t mean unprotected.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comfort and versatility</strong>—the best designs let you wear them crossbody, as a sling, or around the waist without bouncing around.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration-ready options</strong> for anyone who wants the benefit of a bladder system without sacrificing compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choosing What’s Right for You</strong><br>Whether you need the capacity of a hydration pack, the quick access of a fanny pack, or a clear bag to meet gate compliance, choosing the right gear is crucial for a stress-free experience. Festival-ready bags keep your essentials secure, your hands free, and your focus on the music. Here&#8217;s some tips to help you decide what is right for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How much do you carry?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If you bring layers, merch, or snacks, a <strong>festival hydration pack</strong> has you covered.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you prefer essentials only, go for a <strong>hydration fanny pack</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do you need clear compliance?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the policy before you leave. A <strong>clear fanny pack</strong> or <strong>clear hydration backpack</strong> ensures you won’t be turned away at the entrance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What’s your comfort style?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Modular packs let you adjust—crossbody, waist, or sling—so you can dance without feeling restricted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Stay hydrated, stay secure: a guide to festival-ready hydration and fanny packsLostLandLifeStyle 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1-700x404.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401714\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1-700x404.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1-380x220.jpg 380w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1.jpg 1385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: RaveRunner</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/stay-hydrated-stay-secure-a-guide-to-festival-ready-hydration-and-fanny-packs/\">Stay hydrated, stay secure: a guide to festival-ready hydration and fanny packs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>The hype for Tiësto&#8217;s Trance return keeps growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been everywhere already. <strong>Tiësto </strong>is anticipating something huge. Not only did he wipe his socials and post a countdown that leads to this weekend, where he&#8217;ll be playing a Trance set at the LA festival <strong>Dreamstate</strong>, he also changed his logo <strong>to his old, 1999 logo</strong>. Listen, there are lots of signs that hint towards a Trance comeback of the once undisputed king of the genre, and this new one only adds to the fuel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is no drill. Brian Transeau, <strong>BT</strong> himself, just made a post that could very well signify a new conjoint anthem between him and Tijs. Brian, DJ, producer, platinum-selling artist, film composer, and technologist, who made some of the most beautiful pieces such as &#8216;Flaming June&#8217; and &#8216;Mercury &amp; Solace&#8217;, and also went on a couple of small side quests such as soundtracking the iconic Need For Speed Underground trailer and composing records for the 2 Fast 2 Furious box office hit. That BT, <strong>hinted at a new collab with Tiësto</strong>. <strong>And Tiësto replied back</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian recently posted on his <strong>Instagram</strong> a video of Tiësto playing their collaboration from 2004, &#8216;Love Comes Again&#8217;, with the caption &#8220;<em>Who wants a new BT and @tiesto collab?</em>&#8220;. That&#8217;s already good enough. But take a look at who commented:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"312\" height=\"114\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393085\" style=\"width:410px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me.jpg 312w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me-300x110.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And this lone comment sent everyone flying. How wouldn&#8217;t it, to be honest, after they&#8217;ve proven to be an incredible pairing on tracks like the former mentioned and &#8216;Break My Fall&#8217;. We can only hope that this new track they&#8217;re advertising is just as good, or even more so, since both artists now have a ton of extra experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRNd_jOD8rA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "fullContent": "\n<p>&#8216;<strong>Hey Son</strong>&#8216; is the studio chemistry collision of a track between New York melodic duo <strong>MC4D</strong>, Dutch mainstay <strong>Sam Feldt</strong>, German hit machine <strong>VIZE</strong>, and soul powerhouse <strong>Aloe Blacc</strong>. The track is a brass-laced, big-room-leaning house record built for wide-open mainstages and sunset slots. If you loved Avicii&#8217;s &#8216;Wake Me Up&#8217; you&#8217;ll love the bright and feel good track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core is Aloe Blacc’s unmistakable voice delivering the simple but effective hook: “Hey son, I wanna show you how this world is beautiful.” Layered over punchy drums, soaring synth stabs, and a massive horn section, the track radiates uplifting energy that you know from the 2013-2015 era with a modern punch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MC4D, the twin brothers stated: &#8216;<em>Hey Son&#8217; feels really special to us, not only because we’re collaborating with artists we’ve admired for a long time, but because the song captures the energetic music that got us into EDM in the first place. Aloe Blacc’s vocals and the powerful brass melodies create an energy that feels made for festival stages.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The massive track holds especially close to MC4D as they were first inspired to create music in 2013 after they heard &#8216;Wake Me Up&#8217; by Avicii and Aloe Blacc. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRN54UxjfFj/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Here’s what every festivalgoer should know before stepping through the gates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Packs: The All-Day Essential</strong><br>A hydration pack isn’t just for storage, it’s survival gear for long days and late nights. The best festival backpacks keep your water cold, your valuables protected, and your shoulders comfortable. Look for at least a 2 liter hydration capacity, insulation, anti-theft compartments that rest against your back, and padded straps for comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">RaveRunner</a> has a number of <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave/raverunner-hydration-backpack-rave-rave-water-backpack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">hydration packs</a> that stand out for combining both functionality and design, making them one of the go-to sources for seasoned attendees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anti-theft design</strong>: The safest packs keep the main compartment against your back, making it nearly impossible for anyone to access while you’re dancing.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration capacity</strong>: At minimum, you should look for a two-liter hydration pack so you can stay hydrated without constant refills that keep you off the dance floor.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Insulated or cooler-lined compartments</strong> so your drinks stay refreshing even after hours in the sun.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>All-day comfort</strong>: Padded straps, breathable materials, and balanced weight are non-negotiable when you’re wearing it from gates to afters.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Festival-ready features</strong>: Bonus details like chest strap pockets give you a secure but easy-to-reach spot for valuables.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hydration Fanny Packs: Compact, Secure, and Versatile<br></strong>For instant access to your essentials on the dance floor, the hydration fanny pack is the perfect companion. They keep critical items like your phone, ID, and keys securely zipped against your body without weighing you down. Prioritize durable materials, tight zippers, and adjustable straps that can be worn crossbody or around the waist. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/rave-bag/hydration-bag/hydration-crossbody-fanny-pack-rave\">RaveRunner’s hydration fanny packs</a> deliver the comfort, flexibility, and anti-theft features you need for a worry-free night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a hydration fanny pack:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Durable materials </strong>that won’t rip or tear if someone tries to force their way in.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Secure zippers or buckles </strong>that stay closed even when you’re in the middle of the crowd.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Room for hydration: </strong>space to stash a water bottle or soft flask can make a big difference.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comfy &amp; Outfit-friendly</strong>: Find a pack that matches any look and is versatile enough to wear crossbody, around the waist, or slung over the shoulder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clear Bags: Staying Festival-Compliant</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.musicfestivalwizard.com/festival-bag-policy-changes-theft-why-clear-hydration-packs-and-fanny-packs-are-a-must/\">Clear bag policies</a> are now the standard at most major festivals, but that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice utility. Look for transparent bags that meet policy sizing, include hidden pockets, and maintain comfort. <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/product/anti-theft-clear-fanny-pack?type=rave\">RaveRunner’s clear fanny packs</a> and <a href=\"https://raverunner.co/product/clear-backpack-hydro-backpack?type=rave\">clear hydration backpacks</a> let you breeze through the entrance, offering peace of mind and keeping you gate-ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What to look for in a clear festival bag:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Policy-approved sizing</strong> so you don’t get turned away at the gate.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Anti-theft details</strong> like hidden pockets and secure buckles, because clear doesn’t mean unprotected.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Comfort and versatility</strong>—the best designs let you wear them crossbody, as a sling, or around the waist without bouncing around.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hydration-ready options</strong> for anyone who wants the benefit of a bladder system without sacrificing compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Choosing What’s Right for You</strong><br>Whether you need the capacity of a hydration pack, the quick access of a fanny pack, or a clear bag to meet gate compliance, choosing the right gear is crucial for a stress-free experience. Festival-ready bags keep your essentials secure, your hands free, and your focus on the music. Here&#8217;s some tips to help you decide what is right for you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>How much do you carry?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If you bring layers, merch, or snacks, a <strong>festival hydration pack</strong> has you covered.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you prefer essentials only, go for a <strong>hydration fanny pack</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Do you need clear compliance?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Check the policy before you leave. A <strong>clear fanny pack</strong> or <strong>clear hydration backpack</strong> ensures you won’t be turned away at the entrance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>What’s your comfort style?</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Modular packs let you adjust—crossbody, waist, or sling—so you can dance without feeling restricted.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"Stay hydrated, stay secure: a guide to festival-ready hydration and fanny packsLostLandLifeStyle 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1-700x404.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401714\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1-700x404.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1-380x220.jpg 380w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LostLandLifeStyle-1.jpg 1385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: RaveRunner</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/stay-hydrated-stay-secure-a-guide-to-festival-ready-hydration-and-fanny-packs/\">Stay hydrated, stay secure: a guide to festival-ready hydration and fanny packs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>The hype for Tiësto&#8217;s Trance return keeps growing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been everywhere already. <strong>Tiësto </strong>is anticipating something huge. Not only did he wipe his socials and post a countdown that leads to this weekend, where he&#8217;ll be playing a Trance set at the LA festival <strong>Dreamstate</strong>, he also changed his logo <strong>to his old, 1999 logo</strong>. Listen, there are lots of signs that hint towards a Trance comeback of the once undisputed king of the genre, and this new one only adds to the fuel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is no drill. Brian Transeau, <strong>BT</strong> himself, just made a post that could very well signify a new conjoint anthem between him and Tijs. Brian, DJ, producer, platinum-selling artist, film composer, and technologist, who made some of the most beautiful pieces such as &#8216;Flaming June&#8217; and &#8216;Mercury &amp; Solace&#8217;, and also went on a couple of small side quests such as soundtracking the iconic Need For Speed Underground trailer and composing records for the 2 Fast 2 Furious box office hit. That BT, <strong>hinted at a new collab with Tiësto</strong>. <strong>And Tiësto replied back</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian recently posted on his <strong>Instagram</strong> a video of Tiësto playing their collaboration from 2004, &#8216;Love Comes Again&#8217;, with the caption &#8220;<em>Who wants a new BT and @tiesto collab?</em>&#8220;. That&#8217;s already good enough. But take a look at who commented:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"312\" height=\"114\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393085\" style=\"width:410px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me.jpg 312w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tiesto-me-300x110.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And this lone comment sent everyone flying. How wouldn&#8217;t it, to be honest, after they&#8217;ve proven to be an incredible pairing on tracks like the former mentioned and &#8216;Break My Fall&#8217;. We can only hope that this new track they&#8217;re advertising is just as good, or even more so, since both artists now have a ton of extra experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRNd_jOD8rA/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "fullContent": "\n<p>&#8216;<strong>Hey Son</strong>&#8216; is the studio chemistry collision of a track between New York melodic duo <strong>MC4D</strong>, Dutch mainstay <strong>Sam Feldt</strong>, German hit machine <strong>VIZE</strong>, and soul powerhouse <strong>Aloe Blacc</strong>. The track is a brass-laced, big-room-leaning house record built for wide-open mainstages and sunset slots. If you loved Avicii&#8217;s &#8216;Wake Me Up&#8217; you&#8217;ll love the bright and feel good track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core is Aloe Blacc’s unmistakable voice delivering the simple but effective hook: “Hey son, I wanna show you how this world is beautiful.” Layered over punchy drums, soaring synth stabs, and a massive horn section, the track radiates uplifting energy that you know from the 2013-2015 era with a modern punch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MC4D, the twin brothers stated: &#8216;<em>Hey Son&#8217; feels really special to us, not only because we’re collaborating with artists we’ve admired for a long time, but because the song captures the energetic music that got us into EDM in the first place. Aloe Blacc’s vocals and the powerful brass melodies create an energy that feels made for festival stages.” </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The massive track holds especially close to MC4D as they were first inspired to create music in 2013 after they heard &#8216;Wake Me Up&#8217; by Avicii and Aloe Blacc. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRN54UxjfFj/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Nostalgix has locked in the release date for her debut album. <strong>Inferno,</strong> a 10-track LP, drops March 5, 2026 via Monstercat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The Iranian-born, Canadian-raised artist built her name on sharp bass-house productions and her own vocal cuts. Recent singles like &#8216;Holy&#8217; previewed the shift: heavier low-end, darker visuals, and a tighter grip on her narrative. Inferno pushes that direction further, with Nostalgix handling the majority of writing, production, and vocals herself. The rollout comes with a full visual overhaul—blacked-out aesthetics, fire motifs, and cinematic video treatments that tie straight into the album’s theme of controlled combustion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>To support the release, Nostalgix will hit the road with the Inferno Album Tour, starting early 2026. Major cities include San Francisco, Denver, Brooklyn, Dallas, Vancouver. Los Angeles, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DRP01sEEk9Z/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Rooted in her Cree/Halfbreed and Métis heritage, her music merges Indigenous and contemporary sounds into an artform of profound empathy and self-determination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why the Caged Bird Sings” originated as a five-day songwriting and recording workshop engaging small groups of incarcerated individuals and their educators. Each song emerged through a collaborative process where participants contributed lines and melodies shaped by consensus, ensuring every voice was equally heard. The resulting works affirm freedom as both creative expression and self-ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first single, “Here I Am (Bless My Mouth),” co-composed with Gregory Hoskins and featuring the voices of twelve Indigenous female artists, is an anthem of resilience and reclamation. The song was originally written at the Okimaw Ohci Healing Lodge at Nekaneet First Nation and later recorded in studios across Canada, reflecting both the project’s breadth and its unifying vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following in December, the second single, “Can’t Break Us,” co-produced by Mark Schmidt and Cheryl L’Hirondelle, was created with youth at the Paul Dojack Youth Detention Centre in Regina. With lyrics by young writers using aliases to protect their privacy, the song radiates hope and empowerment—asserting that voice and creativity remain unbreakable, even within confinement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>L’Hirondelle describes the collection as ‘freedom songs’—not in the traditional civil rights sense, but through the Cree understanding of tipēyimisowin, meaning self-determination and self-expression. Each song serves as a lyrical declaration of sovereignty, resilience, and the power of collective storytelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the project’s remarkable works are “The Beauty Within,” “Come My Sisters, Come,” and “Live the Life That Is Meant for Me,” each recorded live within correctional institutions in Saskatchewan. These songs blend hand drums, harmonies, and Indigenous chant traditions with contemporary arrangements by long-time collaborators Gregory Hoskins, Mark Schmidt, Glenn Ens, and David Travers-Smith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album’s accompanying videos expand its vision. Three performance films—&#8221;Here I Am, &#8221; &#8220;The Journey Home, &#8221; and &#8220;Live the Life That Is Meant for Me&#8221;—were filmed in Saskatoon, while experimental immersive videos for &#8220;Can’t Break Us, &#8221; &#8220;The Beauty Within, &#8221; and &#8220;To All Our Nations&#8221; tour as part of a multi-sensory exhibition amplifying the voices of participants through technology and art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Why the Caged Bird Sings’ stands as a testament to the restorative power of music. Through this project, Cheryl L’Hirondelle transforms creative collaboration into a space of healing and reclamation, extending the reach of song beyond walls and borders. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://cheryllhirondelle.com/music\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website</a> I <a href=\"https://whythecagedbirdsings.bandcamp.com/album/why-the-caged-bird-sings\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bandcamp</a> I <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61581918088439\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a> I <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ndnsonglines/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/cree-halfbreed-and-metis-artist-cheryl-lhirondelle-releases-transformative-new-album-why-the-caged-bird-sings/\">Cree/Halfbreed and Métis Artist Cheryl L’Hirondelle Releases Transformative New Album ‘Why the Caged Bird Sings&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

&#8216;Say The Word&#8217; (Sultan + Shepard Remix)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping the spirit of the original track intact, Sultan + Shepard continue the sonic experience with a new, captivating, and hypnotic groove. Compared to the original release, the duo chose a club-like atmosphere for the remix. With a stronger and more serious undertone, the track involves warmer melodies and perfectly timed stutters. These elements invoke pure euphoria on the dancefloor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The track follows the massive collaborative history between the duo and the label boss. They have been remixing each other&#8217;s tracks with love and skill. Examples like &#8216;RnR&#8217;, &#8216;I Will Leave A Light On&#8217;, &#8216;Run&#8217;, and &#8216;Survive&#8217;. However, some of their highlights include the tracks they&#8217;ve written and produced together. These include &#8216;The Little Mushroom That Got Away&#8217; and &#8216;Quiet Rush&#8217;. Their joint discography proves that together they&#8217;re a force to reckon with. They help to reinvent each other&#8217;s sounds through the years. Not only is this a successful business partnership, but a work of art.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-sultan-shepard\">Sultan + Shepard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the success of their Trilogy Tour in the Spring, the GRAMMY-nominated duo continued to shine their bright musical light across the world. They did this with their Communicate EP. With multiple appearances in the US, Shepard had a solo performance at the Lightning in a Bottle Music Festival. Meanwhile, Sultan welcomed baby number two with his wife. Up next, the duo will travel alongside Lane 8 for two shows in South Africa. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just &#8216;Say The Word&#8217;: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Say The Word (Sultan + Shepard Remix)\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/6GM0xGeRofLaQ5WRWkbBEE?si=gpBOAV9NQNS5CDVQAlzS9g&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/sultan-shepard-freshen-up-lane-8-arctic-lakes-say-the-word/\">Sultan + Shepard Freshen Up Lane 8, Arctic Lake&#8217;s &#8216;Say The Word&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

the past few months, Australian producer <strong>ZUSO</strong> has been building the anticipation for his upcoming EP with a series of collaborative releases, including <em>Make Me Feel</em> with Sydney producer <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4XkjZzQz3GbVngvYN7hLpW?si=0x7AfgKpR0apWaTd9rFchw\"><strong>Maver</strong></a>, <em>Hurting</em> with Melbourne artist <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4xSveO2Pb18Jyl2f7xW8SW?si=NZni42o5SG25q-WgT8otKw\"><strong>Keelan Mak</strong></a>, and <em>Erase You</em> featuring Melbourne singer <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/4UwWCi0aYGKsyVgCKf20tw?si=gZEXtKhWQYyCwbm3LwPfIA\"><strong>Matilda Pearl</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That EP is set for release in January, and this week ZUSO is giving us another teaser with this inspirational new single called ‘Close To Heaven’, which features the enchanting voice of Burundian/Australian artist <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/6AlUh97NNEBLo3OqYORyIi?si=N5V5da3XSRyeBIwwk20BFQ\"><strong>Beckah Amani</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify

naturally. I wrote the original idea at the end of last year, starting with a really powerful and emotional chord progression that evolved into a euphoric afro house track. I knew it needed a vocal, and Beckah’s voice is honestly incredible. She gave the whole song another level of emotion and presence. We had a studio session together in Sydney and pretty much wrote the lyrics that day. Everything just worked so well, and we both knew we’d made something great.” ~ ZUSO</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blending emotive melodies with euphoric afro house rhythms, ‘Close To Heaven’ is a shining example of ZUSO’s ability to channel deep feeling through dancefloor-ready energy — further cementing his reputation as one of Australia’s most exciting emerging producers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beckah Amani has been captivating audiences with her soulful voice, poetic lyricism, and emotionally rich storytelling. She has received widespread acclaim for her ability to blend vulnerability with strength, weaving personal narratives through a unique blend of soul, R&amp;B, and indie pop. Her collaboration with ZUSO marks an exciting step into the electronic space, showcasing the depth and versatility of her artistry.<br /><br /><strong><em>“I had the most amazing time working on this track! When Zuso reached out and sent me the track, the first thing that jumped out at me was how euphoric and sonically expensive the production was. It made me feel like I was flying or traveling through the galaxy to get to heaven. Lyrically, I wanted to capture this imagery and euphoric mood the production made me feel. I explore how being in love feels like being close to heaven and how special and vulnerable that feeling is. My favourite lyrics in this song “‘cause i’m falling without a parachute” captures this idea so well.” ~ Beckah Amani</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"780\" height=\"780\" data-attachment-id=\"280522\" data-permalink=\"https://findyoursounds.com/zuso-collab-with-beckah-amani-for-close-to-heaven/close-to-heaven_artwork/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?fit=800%2C800&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1761099479&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Close To Heaven_artwork\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?fit=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?fit=780%2C780&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?resize=780%2C780&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-280522\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?resize=768%2C768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Close-To-Heaven_artwork.jpg?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Stream:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://msdistro.lnk.to/CloseToHeaven\">https://msdistro.lnk.to/CloseToHeaven</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>ZUSO:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a href=\"https://linktr.ee/zuso_music\">https://linktr.ee/zuso_music</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Beckah Amani:</strong><br /><a href=\"https://linktr.ee/Beckah_Amani\">https://linktr.ee/Beckah_Amani</a><strong>&nbsp;<br /><br />Credits: </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Produced by Gabriel Cuenca (aka ZUSO)</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Written by Gabriel Cuenca &amp; Beckah Amani</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Mixed &amp; Mastered by Dan Konopka</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Artwork by Eclipse Visuals Photos by Karlo Apostol</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/zuso-collab-with-beckah-amani-for-close-to-heaven/\">ZUSO collab with Beckah Amani for ‘Close To Heaven’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

This project&nbsp; brings all of that influence together.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Neo One’ is a cracking release. Kicking off like a deep tech builder with intricate percussion,&nbsp; ascending minor chord keys soon set the emotional tone. At the start of the second drop, it’s&nbsp; almost as if the string section of an orchestra has entered: what sounds like a violin tugs at the&nbsp; heartstrings in an almost filmic way, providing a stirring trip.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nickelle is a seasoned DJ and has a strong history in dance music. A former resident at the&nbsp; legendary Honeyclub (Brighton), she soon began playing other iconic UK clubs including&nbsp; Turnmills, The Zap, Ministry of Sound and The Escape. These choice gigs led to residencies at&nbsp; Fabric and The End/AKA in London (for DTPM and Jaded respectively), followed by international&nbsp; gigs in far-flung places such as Bali, Bucharest, Rome and Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In tandem with the explosion of her DJ career, Nickelle began producing her own music, releasing&nbsp; on labels such as Slip N Slide, Art &amp; Craft Recordings, Iberian, Bullet:Dodge and Rebirth, as well&nbsp; as remixing the mighty X-Press 2. Now, after a short break, she’s writing the next chapter of her&nbsp; career.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Progressive house don Nolan adds a more percussive clunk on his remix adding to the whole&nbsp; package.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/nickelle-pays-tribute-to-djs-and-producers-of-the-detroit-underground-whose-influence-is-woven-into-new-release-neo-one-on-jsw/\">Nickelle pays tribute to DJs and Producers of the Detroit underground, whose influence is woven into new release, ‘Neo One’ on JSW</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

The opening weekend brings house-heavy headliners <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/?s=disco+lines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disco Lines</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/SOFI-TUKKER\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SOFI TUKKER</a>, and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/The-Blaze/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">The Blaze</a>, setting the tone for another unforgettable season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each following weekend ups the ante with performances from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/DJ-Snake\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DJ Snake</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Madeon/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Madeon</a>, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Elderbrook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elderbrook</a>, Skull Machine — an explosive new bass project from <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Black-Tiger-Sex-Machine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Black Tiger Sex Machine</a> and <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Kai-Wachi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Kai Wachi</a> – <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Max-Styler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Max Styler</a>, and a rare back-to-back set from techno queens, <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Nicole-Moudaber/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nicole Moudaber</a> and Montréal’s own <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/tag/Misstress-Barbara\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Misstress Barbara</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Igloofest wouldn’t be Igloofest without showcasing the city’s thriving local scene. Collectives like Ferias and Homegrown Harvest return for stage takeovers, bringing the underground energy that defines Montréal’s dance music culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Montréal wraps, the Igloofest tour heads across the country — touching down in Gatineau (February 12–14), Québec City (March 6–8), and making its first-ever appearance in Edmonton from March 13–15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://contact.igloofest.ca/presale\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Pre-sale registration</a> opens November 6 at 11 a.m. ET, with general on-sale to follow November 7 via Igloofest’s official website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: Alexis Monet</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DQpEmAzEcH_/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

This included discussing the weather closure on Sunday, which led to congestion at certain stages and pathways throughout the festival. &#8220;While it was uncomfortable, it was a crowd flow issue, and not a surge or crush,&#8221; he stated in the post. &#8220;We had no medical incidents due to this, and it cleared quickly.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rotella also addressed the sole water station that was a major topic of conversation online over the weekend. He stated that at EDC Orlando and other festivals around the country, Insomniac has focused on having one large water station with more refill points rather than smaller ones that have caused congestion throughout the festival grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lineup for EDC Orlando will be revealed next year. The most recent iteration brought forth performances from the likes of Chris Lake, Sara Landry, Gorgon City, SVDDEN DEATH, Armin van Buuren, Porter Robinson, Excision, Subtronics, SOFI TUKKER, James Hype, Dom Dolla, Charlotte de Witte, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Three-day GA, GA+, and VIP passes for EDC Orlando 2026 go on sale Friday, November 21, at 11am ET, with all pass types available on layaway for a deposit down at the time of purchase.

When a fan subscribes, the full value of that subscription flows to the artists they stream. There is no dilution through large pools or formulas that reward the top tier of the industry. The model mirrors how fans already treat their spending habits. If they choose to listen to emerging creators, their money goes directly to those creators.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform’s fraud prevention and user-level tracking are built to keep this system reliable as more listeners join the beta. That reliability is core to Vocana’s messaging. The goal is to remove confusion around royalties and create an environment where every stream holds value for the person making the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Discovery Features Focused On People, Not Algorithms</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"257\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.51.26-PM-1024x257.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82601\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.51.26-PM-1024x257.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.51.26-PM-300x75.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.51.26-PM-768x192.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.51.26-PM-1536x385.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.51.26-PM.png 1916w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of automated ranking systems that push the same handful of artists to the top, Vocana uses curated genre hubs and community-driven recommendations. Fans can browse through sections organized by taste, location, and activity inside the app. They can also interact with artists directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vocana also gives artists access to fan data such as names, emails, cities, and listening histories. That information has been missing from most streaming platforms for years. With it, independent musicians gain the ability to communicate with the people who already support them and shape their release strategies around real engagement instead of guesswork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vocana’s president, Neil Sheehan, has been opening conversations with media ahead of the launch to highlight how these features work in practice. With artist equity discussions gaining traction, the timing positions Vocana as a concrete alternative for creators who want more clarity and control in their careers.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/vocana-positions-itself-as-a-new-option-for-artist-friendly-streaming/\">Vocana Positions Itself As A New Option For Artist-Friendly Streaming</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

When I bought mine it was because I read it was similar to the Roland TR808 and TR909 but cheaper in price. I personally found that it’s different enough to stand out and create groovy and phat rhythms that are more unique to me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this track, I used a few different hi-hat and ride sounds from this machine, layered with some other percussive elements including a very famous drum sample (that I will discuss later). I made my own sample pack using this drum machine, so I have access to sounds I have made and recorded, even when I am travelling. I spent a few days recording different jams of various percussion loops, and then like to use them in different ways in different tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The machine can produce quite a phat sound, and as with a lot of analogue equipment it can also sometimes have a hum / noise on the recordings too. I quite like this because it makes the sounds warm and phat and raw, but often this means I have to EQ them and subtract some frequencies to ensure they don’t overpower other elements in the track, and also that any ‘noise’ is subtle and not too much. During the arrangement process I often automate these parts in / out using EQ or Volume automation to give the feel of being mixed live on a mixing desk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought this was a good thing to share because many producers don’t have access to studios, so even if you don’t have a drum machine, you can still find great sample packs that have big phat sounds you can use and create an analogue sound in the box. For example, the snare in this track is a sample which I split into two channels, left and right, to create more interest. And it can be nice to cut them up into one hits and play them in. Or cut them up and change the rhythms slightly every few bars too, to add more variation than a straight up sampled repetitive loop which can sounds boring and ‘blocky’.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Amen Break Drum Sample</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-Other-non-synth-SAMPLE-AMEN-DRUM-BREAK-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82594\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-Other-non-synth-SAMPLE-AMEN-DRUM-BREAK-1024x640.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-Other-non-synth-SAMPLE-AMEN-DRUM-BREAK-300x188.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-Other-non-synth-SAMPLE-AMEN-DRUM-BREAK-768x480.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-Other-non-synth-SAMPLE-AMEN-DRUM-BREAK.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amen Break sample is probably one of the most sampled drum breaks of all time, credited for being a foundational element of drum and bass and jungle. If the Amen Break didn’t exist would we even have dance music as we now know it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually, I try to stay away from really ‘obvious’ samples, or things that have been used a lot. However, this track I actually made by mistake! I was using this sample to teach some producers about sampling as part of my Find Your Own Sound Masterclass. I picked this sample for obvious reasons, so I was initially just using it as an example, alongside some acapella vocals, to show them different ways of sampling. When I started jamming with this drum loop, the vocals, a few other percussion elements and played in a New York sounding bass, it really gelled together nicely. Probably because I wasn’t even intending on making a track from it, so it flowed effortlessly as there was no pressure to create. I really liked it, so I decided to finish it and release it, using the vocal samples to create synth like hook patterns and melodies by sampling them in different ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, this Amen Break sample was from a royalty free sample pack, but when I first uploaded the demo to soundcloud, another producer had also used it, and copyrighted their track, so my track was flagged as being a copy of his track, which it wasn’t, we had just both used the same sample!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why I advise people, (and usually also do it myself) to change any samples / loops used in some way, to make it your own. Not just because it makes it more unique to you, and more interesting (variation within elements is key), but also to avoid things like this. In this instance, luckily I uploaded the demo before it was released, so when I saw the notification, I edited the sample so that it would not be flagged and taken down in future. Cutting it up and moving it around, or changing the pitch can work well for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waves CLA-2A</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Other-non-synth-CLA-2A-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82591\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Other-non-synth-CLA-2A-1024x640.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Other-non-synth-CLA-2A-300x188.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Other-non-synth-CLA-2A-768x480.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-Other-non-synth-CLA-2A.png 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Waves CLA-2A is probably my favourite plug-in. It is modelled after the legendary electro-optical tube compressor: Teletronix LA-2A. It gives any sound depth that makes even digital sounds sound analogue. It adds clarity, character, brightness and warmth and I absolutely love it. Of course we want to use phat sounds in the first place though, and not rely on plug-ins to improve weak sounds (ideally don’tt use weak sounds in the first place!), but this can really help to beef up sounds when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this track, I used this compressor on the bass. Because I was demonstrating to the students, I wanted to mostly use sounds and effects that were easily available to them. So I used a Logic stock bass for the bass. It was a New York-sounding ‘Hollow Bass’, and despite being a lovely sound, it was quite weak, especially in comparison to the other sounds in the track. So I used the CLA-2A to help give it extra warmth, depth and brightness, as well as adding an Amp, and a subharmonic synthesiser effect, to enhance the low end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love to use it on any sound that I want to add warmth/depth / clarity too. It works really well on percussion, vocals and bass! Although, I recommend using it on the individual tracks rather than on a group, so they sit in their own energy nicely. You can always add a different compressor / EQ / reverb on a group to gel it together also. We want that balance between each sound cutting through the mix individually, as well as making the music feel it’s coming from the same place, as one group too.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Parallel EQ Technique</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"689\" height=\"489\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-Other-Technique-Paralell-EQ-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82595\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-Other-Technique-Paralell-EQ-1.png 689w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-Other-Technique-Paralell-EQ-1-300x213.png 300w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 689px) 100vw, 689px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’m sure most producers have heard of Parallel Compression, but have you heard of Parallel EQ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parallel EQ is a way of using sends and EQ to create more depth, movement, space and width in your music. And unlike the previous example, this is best done on groups. I particularly like it used on a group of percussion, or a group of vocals. Or both (done separately)!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, I am using Parallel EQ on the Percussion to make it feel even more alive. If we are making music electronically / in the box, we must remember to humanise it and make it feel more alive somehow… And this is a great way to do just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firstly select all the percussion (not including the Kicks) and use a send / group, to send part of the signal of all percussive elements to two separate busses / groups, which are then sent to the main output, whilst also keeping the sounds intact where they were originally too. So essentially creating three layers of the same sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, I add an EQ plug-in to each group and slightly enhance / subtract certain frequencies on each, ideally subtly and different to each other, for this example I am just using the Logic stock EQ. Then, we pan one group Left and one group Right. I usually do this around 20 + / &#8211; for each, so it isn’t obvious that this has been done, but still gives an amazing added depth to the sounds alongside the original sounds that are still in their original pan place (mostly in the middle with a few subtly panned left and right).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is similar to parallel compression, but because we are adjusting different frequencies on the EQ of each Left / Right group, which is layered on top of the original sounds, it gives a feeling of more spaciousness, and depth, as well as more width to the tracks. And because they are panned left and right it means each side is slightly different, creating even more feeling of humanisation and realness, even with digitally made sounds, and also avoids any phase cancellation from grouping the same sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paralle; EQ works particularly well on percussion groups, and vocal groups, when there are multiple layers that can be sent to the Left and Right busses. I like to use it quite subtly but you can experiment with using it more obviously too. It can also work well on synth layers as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hot Takes On Producing Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"799\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.46.22-PM-1024x799.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82596\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.46.22-PM-1024x799.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.46.22-PM-300x234.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.46.22-PM-768x599.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-1.46.22-PM.jpg 1227w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hot Take 1:</strong> Dj’s who learnt their craft playing long sets and warm ups in empty rooms, building it up until it got busier are not respected enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Hot Take 2:</strong> Remember all early house music often used only 8 track recording.

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

The Washington Commanders football team has selected global architecture firm <a href=\"https://www.hksinc.com\"><strong>HKS</strong></a> to lead the complete redevelopment of the 180-acre campus. This project carries a projected cost of <strong>$2.7 billion</strong>. Construction begins in spring 2027, and completion is set for 2030. The new plan will impact everything from sports, housing, entertainment, and festivals like <strong>Project Glow</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-what-the-redevelopment-includes\">What the Redevelopment Includes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RFK Stadium will seat 65,000 people and feature a full roof. This design allows year-round use for games, concerts, and major live events. The area around the stadium will also change in major ways. In detail, developers plan to add 5,000 to 6,000 homes, affordable housing, community spaces, and a large new riverfront zone. The existing youth sports fields will remain to support local programs. Altogether, the design focuses on walkability, transit access, sustainability, and a better connection to the Anacostia River.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-how-this-affects-project-glow\">How This Affects Project Glow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Project Glow uses the RFK grounds each spring to host one of the East Coast’s most popular dance music festivals. The redevelopment creates a different festival landscape. In 2030, A completed stadium could allow future main stages indoors or outdoors with advanced lighting, improved production, and a new experience all around. Additional green spaces and public areas also create flexible layouts for multi-stage setups. Festival traffic, parking, and metro access should improve as the site becomes more efficient. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1.jpg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-1024x492.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393095\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-1024x492.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-300x144.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-768x369.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-1536x737.jpg 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-2048x983.jpg 2048w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-696x334.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-1068x513.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-1920x922.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/pg_2026_mk_te_soc_3200x1526_r03-scaled-1-875x420.jpg 875w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the RFK grounds will begin new operations with a new stadium, making it possible that Project Glow will have to search for a different location due to affordability, schedule conflicts, and more.

MANDRAKE warns that when combined with ketamine, the mixture is likely to cause &#8220;<em>extreme prolonged sedation, which could prove fatal.</em>&#8221; The organization also highlighted the serious non-fatal risks, including &#8220;<em>sexual assault and robbery</em>,&#8221; associated with this level of sedation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medetomidine is chemically similar to <strong>xylazine</strong>, another veterinary tranquilliser sometimes found in contaminated ketamine, but is reportedly <strong>200 times more potent</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-harm-reduction-advice\">Harm Reduction Advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>MANDRAKE advises users to take the following precautions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Test the Drug:</strong> Users should test ketamine with <strong>medetomidine test strips</strong> before use.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dose Cautiously:</strong> Wait <strong>&#8220;<em>at least an hour</em>&#8220;</strong> after taking a very small initial bump before consuming any more.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone is suspected of taking contaminated ketamine and becomes unconscious, it is critical to <strong>contact a medical or welfare professional immediately</strong>.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>In electronic music, impact often happens in places the audience never sees. Some artists build their profile through visibility; others influence the scene through years of work behind the desk. Jay Pryor belongs to the latter group, a producer whose contributions have long reached global audiences without carrying his name directly. With the release of “Funk 2 Da” on Realm Records, the label founded by Gorgon City, Pryor steps into a more public phase of his career. The single marks a shift from supporting roles toward a clearer expression of his own identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pryor began developing his sound in Dublin before entering larger writing and production circles. His early breakthrough came as a co-producer on “Just Hold On,” the Louis Tomlinson and Steve Aoki collaboration that reached more than 600 million streams and earned multiple platinum certifications. This placed him inside major projects early on, and in the years that followed he contributed to work involving Diplo, ZAYN, Niall Horan, Alan Walker, Anne-Marie, and Alok. Across these collaborations he built a reputation for clean production, balanced structure, and reliable execution. Even with more than a billion streams and over a million monthly listeners, Pryor’s individual artistic identity remained separate from the high-profile cuts he helped shape. His early catalog, including “Say Something,” “Good For Me,” and “Space Jam,” hinted at possible directions but lacked the focused definition he is now embracing. “Funk 2 Da” changes that dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Realm Records has become a home for artists who value rhythm, clarity, and functionality in their house productions, and Pryor’s recent stylistic shift moves him closer to that aesthetic. The connection to Realm began when Dom Dolla started playing “Funk 2 Da” in his sets, giving the record early real-world testing. Strong crowd reactions helped pave the way for the signing. The release represents an alignment between Pryor’s personal sound and a label that mirrors the style he gravitates toward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Funk 2 Da” is defined by a certain level of holding back. Rather than stacking multiple layers or aiming for oversized drops, Pryor builds the record around a centered bassline, clipped vocal accents, and clean, forward-moving percussion. The arrangement remains minimal, with each element serving a clear purpose. Its momentum comes from pacing rather than density, reflecting Pryor’s understanding of both pop structure and club functionality. The result is a straightforward track that works not because of what it adds, but because of what it intentionally leaves out. It reveals a producer confident enough in his craft to focus on essentials.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"941\" height=\"846\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393043\" style=\"width:1068px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106.png 941w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106-300x270.png 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106-768x690.png 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106-696x626.png 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133106-467x420.png 467w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Pryor’s work spans Los Angeles, Dublin, London, and Sydney, and each environment has demanded different creative modes. Writing for major artists requires clarity, precision, and structure, while crafting club records requires repetition, tension, and flow. Over time he learned to merge these approaches instead of choosing between them. That blend explains why his productions attract support from a wide range of artists including John Summit, Gorgon City, Cloonee, Skream, Tiësto, Diplo, and Chris Lake. His tracks are adaptable, built simply yet sturdy enough to fit across varied styles and settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deeper transition behind Pryor’s recent output is personal. After years of shaping music for others, the essential question became what he wanted his own work to sound like. “Funk 2 Da” doesn’t attempt to summarize his whole career; instead, it represents a decision to trust his instincts more directly. Leaning heavily on the pop sensibilities he mastered, Pryor refocuses on rhythm, movement, and simplicity here in a beautiful manner. The clarity in the production mirrors a growing clarity in direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3MkJiPfIi5sUN24WATi1kg?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>“Funk 2 Da” points toward a period of greater visibility for Jay Pryor. His foundation is already solid, with major collaborations, strong streaming numbers, and continued support from established DJs. What changes now is the emphasis on his own releases. The single marks a subtle but important shift from being a contributor to becoming a central voice in his own body of work. His next steps appear guided by the same traits that shaped his years behind the scenes: careful decision-making, clean execution, and confidence in the strength of simple ideas.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133020.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"517\" height=\"771\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133020.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393042\" style=\"width:1068px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133020.png 517w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133020-201x300.png 201w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-18-133020-282x420.png 282w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 517px) 100vw, 517px\" /></a></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/jay-pryor-funk-2-da/\">Jay Pryor: A Producer Whose Work Has Quietly Shaped Modern Pop Steps Forward With “Funk 2 Da”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

Having united as LUSU in recent years, they’ve enjoyed a flurry of high-impact moments in recent times, collaborating with HI-LO for last year’s stunning ‘DIZZY’ on <strong>Drumcode</strong>, while also dropping heat on HILOMATIK and Arcane including a huge link-up with Eli Brown on ‘Escape from Planet Monday’ featuring Sarah De Warren.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dutch duo seem to get better with every release, and bring forth more mind-bending sounds on their debut solo EP ‘Move 2 the Groove’ on Drumcode which is out now. They share their story with EDMTunes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Move 2 the Groove\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/59lESu9zvNwuAKyp1vqqZA?si=S6yRfc8sSsSziLEHDpFmNg&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re a new name to many. Tell us about yourselves for the uninitiated.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey! We’re Mike and Wiwek from Amsterdam and before we started our project LUSU we’ve been touring around the world individually for about ten years. A few years ago LUSU was founded organically after a weekend of studio time in a nature house. Nowadays we are fully focused on getting our sound out there in the techno world. 🙂</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Who are your production heroes? The artists who have been crucial in</strong> <strong>inspiring your sound?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are super inspired with this project by acts like Drunken Kong, Skrillex, Eli Brown and much more. Listening to them and seeing their shows definitely helped us shape our LUSU sound. We also love to just check out other DJs and see how they curate their sets. The first steps in our sound were inspired by going to sets from Lucky Done Gone, Tsepo for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You first debuted on Drumcode in collaboration with HI-LO no less, with</strong> <strong>‘DIZZY’. A huge hook up. How did it all come about?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike and Oliver (HI-LO) knew each other from an earlier collaboration in 2018 and they kept in touch ever since. Oliver was also one of the first industry guys that supported our music and he was excited to collaborate with us on ‘DIZZY’!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you’re in the studio writing music, are you in a free-flowing creative</strong> <strong>state? Or are you intentional, making tracks for specific labels?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really depends. We usually have a plan to finish a track for a specific label. For example, we send a lot of demos directly to Eli Brown, sometimes just a drop, but he’ll tell us if he likes it for Arcane and then we finish it. To get into the real free-flowing creative state, we have a tradition to rent a house in the middle of nowhere, take our gear and just create whatever comes to mind. We do this about twice a year and get a lot of good demos from these sessions!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you focus on manifesting career goals? Or how else do you approach your</strong> <strong>career planning? What would you like to realise in 2026?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might say that. Almost everything we had in mind for LUSU has been coming to life lately. Collabs with people like Eli Brown and HI-LO, getting support from the biggest names in the scene and now an EP on the legendary Drumcode imprint. For 2026 we have much more to come, we’re super excited about that. We hope to be playing more shows around the world, reach our fans and tell our musical story on all continents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you mostly creating in the box or outside? What’s a dream bit of kit you’d</strong> <strong>love to add to your studio?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before starting LUSU, we each spent about a decade touring and releasing music individually, coming from a different scene than the traditional techno world. That background naturally shapes our sound. We love pushing boundaries and creating outside the box creatively, bringing our own twist and energy from where we come from. At the same time, we always aim to respect the core values of techno. For us, LUSU is about blending our unique roots with what makes techno timeless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your new EP ‘Move 2 the Groove’ on Drumcode is fantastic. When did you start</strong> <strong>producing it and how did it take shape?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you! We actually started with the vocal sample saying ‘Move 2 The Groove’, which instantly gave us inspiration for the whole track. This is one of those tracks that gets created fast and naturally. It just works as it is and Adam Beyer heard that right away. He’s been playing it around for months now and decided he wanted to release it on Drumcode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Share a musical and non-musical 2025 highlight.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our musical highlight of the year is probably visiting Awakenings during ADE. Right after we entered the building we had to go through security and that’s when we already heard an unreleased LUSU ID being played. During the night we heard about five unreleased ID’s, which was a confirmation we’re on the right path. Mike: “A non-musical 2025 highlight of mine would be just hanging out with my 2-year old son. I love spending time with him and seeing him grow up.” Wiwek: “A non music highlight of 2025 for me is seeing Mike with his son!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s a cause you’re passionate about?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We both care about respecting nature and animals. That might be one of the reasons we like to build a studio in a natural environment to get our ideas flowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Any tips for up-and-coming producers facing creative or career blocks?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really depends on what type of writer’s blocks you have. Sometimes it’s best to check out all the music that’s out there. Not just on Spotify or Apple Music, but also Soundcloud, Bandcamp etc. There’s a deep pool of inspiring music out there. But sometimes it’s also best to just stop listening to music at all for a while. What helps us usually is getting some new fresh sounds / samplepacks and playing around with new plug-ins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s coming up next for you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point we just released our ‘Move 2 The Groove’ EP on Drumcode, which we are super excited about. Next up is another release coming on Drumcode next month! More info on that soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>LUSU’s ‘Move 2 the Groove’ is out now on Drumcode: </strong><a href=\"https://drumcode.ffm.to/dc339\"><strong>https://drumcode.ffm.to/dc339</strong></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/lusu-move-2-the-groove/\">LUSU: The Amsterdam duo rewiring Techno with ‘Move 2 the Groove’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "\n<p>We recently chatted with an absolute star on the rise for his latest work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trance </strong>is a beautiful thing. And when we found out about one of the most beautiful Trance releases of the year, Paul Skelton, Andy Newtz and Tara Green&#8217;s &#8216;<strong>Angel</strong>&#8216;, we decided to go hands-on about it. You&#8217;d have read by now <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/10/ciaran-mcauley-michael-alan-remixes-paul-skelton-angel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">our review of the remix EP</a>, which included remixes by <strong>Michael Alan</strong> and <strong>Ciaran McAuley</strong>. Well, we sat down with the former to catch up on it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DJ, Vocalist and Producer from Perth, Mike has grown to develop a rather strong bond with Electronic music. Once a fan and a devoted listener, now he contributes to the rich history of Dance music with his own creations. Made famous for his endless sets on his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@michaelalan89/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube channel</a>, things have escalated steadily for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Angel (Michael Alan Remix)\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/43QIwthufOfmrimCiIODRN?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that he landed this impeccable old-school sounding remix for &#8216;Angel&#8217;, it was the absolute right time to speak with him about the release, his career, and his vision as a fellow artist. So, without further to do, here&#8217;s our sincere, warm little chat <strong>with the one and only Michael Alan</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-interview\">The Interview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Congratulations on the release of your remixes for ‘Angel’! To begin with, we’d love to know, how do you like the original version? What does it make you feel?<br></strong><br>Thank you so much! To put it simply, the original is such a banger. It’s overflowing with the uplifting Trance vibes that I grew up listening to, and Paul’s piano work &#8211; as a classical pianist myself &#8211; is something I’ve always been really attracted to. There’s no doubt the original has all of the important hallmarks of what I love about dance music: deep, driving, melodic, emotional, uplifting Trance! That should be enough for any man or woman!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393050\" style=\"width:644px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-696x464.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-210-copy-copia-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Talk us through your remixing process for the track. How did you come to work on it? Were there any challenges while flipping the track to your style?<br></strong><br>Big shout out to Marcel @ Amon Vision for hooking us up with this one! My sound is really heavily influenced by early 2000s Trance, House and progressive. I also love film score, so you’ll usually see at least some thick Hans Zimmer-like strings in my breakdowns. Because so many of those classic Trance elements were already kind of there, I found it a relatively easy flip &#8211; definitely a lot of fun to remix!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I guess it’s a surprise to no one that we’re constantly being bombarded with oceans of <em>meh</em> music released at all times. What would you say makes your remix of ‘Angel’ special, how does it stand out?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m really trying to hone in on a focused sound at the moment. To consistently produce music that has a recognizable trademark. I love a really clean, focused mix that should sound sweet on the ear, without anything harsh or fatiguing. To give an example, I think tracks like ATB &#8211; &#8216;Till I Come&#8217; are basically timeless, because they bounce like house and emote like only Trance can!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you had the chance to test your remix while DJing? If so, how’s the audience reaction been?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t yet! We’re just coming out of quite a long, cold winter here in Perth &#8211; so, while the shows are booked &#8211; road testing it is a few weeks away!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s one track, either yours or not, that you’d say changed your life in a way? If you’ve got a song with a strong personal story linked to it, for example.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignright is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Clear Blue Water - Ferry Corsten Remix\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3MbmDUxmBjLU6ZHC4FFuWE?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, there are so many. Always hard to pick one. But one that always stands out is Ferry Corsten’s remix of OceanLab &#8211; Clear Blue Water. Back in 2012, my old production partner Joe and I were playing to a sold-out Villa crowd for Amon Vision’s Trance Anthems night, wall-to-wall people in white, pure energy in the air. I’d planned to play the Mike Shiver remix, but Joe stopped me mid-reach and said, “Trust me. Play the Ferry mix.” I’d never even heard it before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The moment I dropped it in blind… everything stopped. Seven minutes of absolute euphoria &#8211; like DJing to the crowd AND being in the crowd all at once. That experience, that feeling of being completely swept away by the music you’re sharing &amp; simultaneously learning &#8211; it’s something I’ve spent my whole life trying to recreate since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We still call Ferry “The Lord” to this day haha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is Trance such a special genre of music to listen to? What would you say is the core characteristic of the genre?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels to me like unfiltered emotion &#8211; like it’s specifically designed to make people feel something more deeply than what&#8217;s at the surface. That in itself is a uniquely human experience &#8211; which I think especially today &#8211; is possibly the most important thing we can place a premium on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could go back in time, say 10 years or any number of years you’d find interesting, and meet your past self, what would you tell that younger you? Were you worrying about something that wasn’t really necessary?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’d just pass on all my production techniques &amp; knowledge! I wouldn’t change anything else &#8211; and I reckon younger me would be pretty happy with a few level ups 🙂</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-393049\" style=\"width:319px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-200x300.jpg 200w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-696x1043.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-1068x1601.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia-280x420.jpg 280w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MichaelW_Studio_Feb2021_KSDM-116-copy-copia.jpg 1366w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you see yourself in a few years’ time? How do you want people to know/remember you by?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to keep making honest music and enjoying the process! Outside of the studio, I’m at my absolute happiest and complete when I’m playing live &#8211; sharing the music and expressing/performing what the music means to me. There’s nothing better than that!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\">Final Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What a legend. Loved hearing from Mike, and what he had to say about the scene, as well as the remix itself. Gosh, I got remembered of that Ferry remix of &#8216;Clear Blue Water&#8217;, such a powerful tune. As is his remix of &#8216;Angel&#8217;! Elegant Progressive Trance reminiscent of yesteryear, it&#8217;s a jewel if you dare play it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks again for this interview, and thanks to Marcel from Amon Vision for linking us as well! The label is consistently putting out bangers, if you haven&#8217;t yet, you must give it a listen: they don&#8217;t miss.

The <strong>NDSM Docklands</strong> will once again become the beating heart of electronic music as DGTL celebrates its 14th edition from April 3-5, 2026. This iconic industrial site transforms into a futuristic playground where cutting-edge music collides with immersive art, all while pushing the boundaries of sustainability and community. The festival has just dropped its first wave of artist announcements, and it&#8217;s a mouth-watering mix of international heavyweights, innovative live acts, and the rising stars who are shaping tomorrow&#8217;s sound.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When Saturday April 4th rolls around, expect the energy levels to hit the ceiling. British duo<strong> Camelphat</strong> will be serving up their signature blend of progressive house and melodic techno—those euphoric build-ups and emotional crescendos that make dance floors come alive. Meanwhile, Manchester&#8217;s <strong>Interplanetary Criminal</strong> injects raw UK garage energy with sharp breaks and rhythms pulled straight from the city&#8217;s thriving underground scene. Over on the Modular Stage, <strong>Gotu Jim</strong> delivers a live performance that&#8217;s become legendary for fusing dark hip hop, house, and trap with splashes of hyper pop and emo house. His tracks capture that beautiful contradiction of nightlife—euphoric yet introspective, uplifting yet deeply emotional.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">DGTL favorite <strong>Jayda G</strong> makes her return, ready to light up the crowd with her irresistible fusion of disco, house, and funk. Beyond her infectious sound, she brings a message that resonates perfectly with DGTL&#8217;s ethos, including her powerful documentary <strong>Blue Carbon</strong>, which explores the intersection of music, science, and environmental awareness. The turntables will also see a special moment when <strong>Kamma</strong> and <strong>Yu Su</strong> join forces for their first-ever B2B set at DGTL—expect soulful grooves meeting cosmic house as Amsterdam&#8217;s flow intertwines with dreamy, textured soundscapes touched by subtle Chinese folk influences. And if you&#8217;re looking for something truly unforgettable, <strong>horsegiirL</strong>&#8216;s new audiovisual live show promises to blur the line between performance art and full-throttle rave, delivering an irreverent, surreal explosion of vocals, visuals, and hyperactive club energy.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Sunday April 5th brings the weekend to a spectacular close with a lineup that spans the entire electronic music spectrum. Fresh off his explosive ADE performance and that surprise pop-up rave at Amsterdam Central Station, Groningen&#8217;s <strong>Benwal</strong> returns with the unstoppable momentum that&#8217;s made him one of the Netherlands&#8217; fastest-rising stars. His sets are a high-octane blend of hard trance, rave, and house with contemporary twists that will leave you breathless. Grammy nominee <strong>Dom Dolla</strong> arrives with his crowd-pleasing house sound—groovy, powerful, and engineered for pure mass euphoria. On the more intense end,<strong> I Hate Models</strong> crafts emotional journeys through melancholic synthwave, trance, and industrial techno, creating that perfect fusion where raw aesthetics meet dance floor intensity.</p>\n<p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Keep an eye on <strong>Odymel</strong>, whose eclectic mix of house, techno, trance, and eurodance has made him one of the scene&#8217;s most exciting new voices since his 2023 breakthrough. His melodies somehow feel both nostalgic and revolutionary at the same time. Berlin&#8217;s <strong>DJ Gigola</strong> brings her playful yet fierce approach, mixing techno, rap, and hyperpop into a uniquely infectious rave experience. Amsterdam&#8217;s own <strong>Luuk van Dijk</strong> delivers that recognizable warm, swinging house groove that keeps bodies moving, while <strong>Weval</strong> takes the stage with their cinematic live show that has evolved toward a more dancefloor-focused direction without losing any of that emotional depth and rich texture they&#8217;re known for.</p>\n<p><iframe title=\"DGTL ADE 2025 | AFTERMOVIE\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qkLTZrr22lA?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n",

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation. His &#8220;One Sound, Two Sides&#8221; philosophy translates into production that feels equally at home during peak-time festival moments and those rare club instances when everyone actually connects with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What separates this from typical progressive fare is TR3AL&#8217;s stated ambition beyond the booth. He&#8217;s developing a fully immersive live show incorporating visuals and motion-capture characters, treating each release as a narrative chapter rather than isolated singles. That cinematic storytelling approach is already evident in &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; &#8211; the track builds with genuine dramatic arc rather than just hitting familiar progressive house checkpoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a debut album and live show planned for 2026, TR3AL&#8217;s positioning himself as more than another festival circuit DJ. &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; captures what he describes as &#8220;the rush of energy you feel when you&#8217;re fully present&#8221; &#8211; ambitious conceptual framework aside, the track simply works as both emotional statement and dancefloor weapon. That balance is harder to achieve than it sounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6CtNFlZYtifblpZy7SGASX?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/tr3al-gets-into-the-feels-on-never-ending-love/\">TR3AL gets into the feels on &#8216;Never Ending Love&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

At each corner there are various food joints, amenities such as the Beauty Bar, and plenty of space to roam around. On the outer edges Headliners could find all the EDC essentials: info booths, merch tents, free water refills, and more! Light-up tunnels guide you into the colorful center of EDC and make for a great meeting spot with friends.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for a Wonderful EDC Las Vegas 2021!</h2>\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic was, and still is in many ways, a difficult time for everyone, but we are infinitely grateful to have been able to reunite with our Headliners this year Under The Electric Sky.

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

Led by the raw and anthemic single “<strong>Outsider</strong>,” the record bridges classic country storytelling with modern reflections on identity and self-discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Produced by acclaimed sonic craftsman&nbsp;<strong>Erik P.H. Nielsen</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>City and Colour</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Blue Moon Marquee</strong>),&nbsp;<strong><em>Romance and Ramblin’</em></strong>&nbsp;finds&nbsp;<strong>Eric</strong>&nbsp;“<strong>The Duke</strong>”&nbsp;<strong>Duquette</strong>&nbsp;and<strong>&nbsp;Jena</strong>&nbsp;“<strong>Goldie</strong>”&nbsp;<strong>Gogo&nbsp;</strong>distilling the soul of country music through their own lived experiences. Drawing inspiration from icons like Loretta Lynn, Gram Parsons, and Lucinda Williams, the pair reimagine the heartland sound for a new generation – one defined by vulnerability, warmth, and truth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’ve always been a big fan of classic 70’s outlaw country music – folks like Waylon, Willie and Kristofferson,” says&nbsp;<strong>Eric</strong>. “Except I don’t live on a ranch, drive a pickup truck, ride horses or have any of the usual country accoutrement. So I felt like a bit of an outsider. When I went back and listened to those old records that I loved so much, I realized that they were singing about being outsiders too. And ultimately, isn’t being an outsider what country is really about?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Listen:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/dukeandgoldie/romance-and-ramblin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/dukeandgoldie/romance-and-ramblin</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Romance and Ramblin&amp;apos;\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2C7HaC8hTdm9VHAtksCk5j?si=y7wyaeovRxubSXhGAGKWNg&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That theme of self-acceptance drives “<strong>Outsider</strong>,” a song that transforms personal reflection into a rallying cry for authenticity. With its stripped-back arrangement – dobro taking the place of pedal steel, minimal electric guitar, and a warm tape delay captured through an old reel-to-reel machine – the track glows with nostalgic grit. The vocal performance, recorded live in the booth while&nbsp;<strong>Nielsen</strong>&nbsp;manually adjusted the analog delay, captures the immediacy of classic country storytelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On stage,&nbsp;<strong>Duke &amp; Goldie</strong>’s chemistry is undeniable – playful, magnetic, and deeply connected. Their intertwining harmonies and vivid storytelling transform each performance into a shared moment of wonder.&nbsp;<strong><em>Romance and Ramblin’&nbsp;</em></strong>is a testament to that bond – two voices, one vision, and an open road stretching endlessly ahead.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/duke-goldie-celebrate-identity-and-authenticity-on-new-ep-romance-and-ramblin-featuring-gritty-lead-single-outsider/\">Duke &amp; Goldie Celebrate Identity and Authenticity on New EP ‘Romance and Ramblin’,’ Featuring Gritty Lead Single “Outsider”</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

Her topline has a head-spinning hyperpop allure, which is tailed by the track’s neon-lit arpeggios and rainbow road-esque melodies. Trotting techno rhythms are the asphalt that pave the way for shrieking synth modulations, plucky basslines, and candy-coated bleeps and bloops that make for one futuristic ride.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Touching on the blatant chance in tone they took for their collaboration, <strong>Habstrakt </strong>shares, <em>“This new one with </em><strong><em>ElmyX </em></strong><em>hits different—far from our usual vibe, yet it still feels like home.”&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Echoing his sentiments, <strong>ElmyX </strong>adds: <em>“I love this new song with Habstrakt. It feels so unique, but blends our sounds so well. I hope the world loves it, too!”&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The single pulls up right in time for the kickoff of the official <strong>‘Off My Head’ Tour, </strong>with the first show taking place at <strong>Exchange LA</strong>. It’s expected to be a frenzy of bouncy and bass-heavy vibes, and further establishes the electric connection between <strong>Habstrakt </strong>and <strong>ElmyX. </strong>They have crossed paths on numerous remixes throughout the year, and recently joined forces for the “<strong>2015</strong>” collab for <strong>Habstrakt</strong>’s ‘<strong>From Within (part 1)’ EP</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LA-based producer <strong>Habstrakt </strong>is a French expat who has reshaped the landscape for bass-heavy house music over the years, continually breaking through the glass ceiling for what&#8217;s possible for low-end producers worldwide. Habstrakt has headline shows at <strong>Skyway Theatre, Showbox SoDo, The Royal Grove, </strong>and <strong>Effex Night Club, </strong>as well as festival plays at <strong>Forbidden Kingdom, Monster Energy Up, </strong>and tour support for <strong>Subtronics ‘Fibonacci.’&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parisian producer <strong>ElmyX </strong>is an audiovisual extraordinaire, known for taking an experimental angle on house and techno.&nbsp;With “<strong>Off My Head,</strong>” the three artists showcase their collective versatility and set the tone for a new chapter in each of their artistic journeys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Habstrakt, ElmyX, &amp; Simona Shao’s new single “Off My Head” is available on all platforms via GOTTA MOVE.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?ssl=1\"><img data-recalc-dims=\"1\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"780\" height=\"709\" data-attachment-id=\"280495\" data-permalink=\"https://findyoursounds.com/habstrakt-elmyx-and-simona-shao-fuse-their-talents-on-their-latest-high-energy-house-track-off-my-head-via-gotta-move/www-ohdagyophoto-com/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?fit=800%2C727&amp;ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"800,727\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;Jason Fenmore&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;www.OHDAGYOPHOTO.com&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1736705566&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;Oh Dag Yo Photo \\u00a9 2025&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;www.OHDAGYOPHOTO.com&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"www.OHDAGYOPHOTO.com\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"&lt;p&gt;www.OHDAGYOPHOTO.com&lt;/p&gt;\n\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?fit=300%2C273&amp;ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?fit=780%2C709&amp;ssl=1\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?resize=780%2C709&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-280495\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?resize=300%2C273&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/findyoursounds.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HabstraktStudioShootFullRES-011.jpg?resize=768%2C698&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" /></a><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><a href=\"http://www.OHDAGYOPHOTO.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.OHDAGYOPHOTO.com</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Habstrakt&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Habstrakt (Adam Jouneau) is a long-standing icon in the bass music scene.

He got supported by big artists and DJs, people started to recognize him, and his project is now musically and visually well defined.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, he released 1 official remix for Daddy DJ and 2 for Habstrakt&#8217;s ‘Heritage’ remix album.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, 2024, marks the launch of his debut EP, ‘Lost In A Dream’, a project that enhances the artist&#8217;s vision in both music and visuals, created by ElmyX himself. The EP has attracted the attention of many international DJs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also played for the first time in the prestigious club ‘L’Amnésia’. A behind-the-scenes producer, he has also worked for several world-renowned artists.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Connect with ElmyX&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Facebook</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Instagram</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Twitter</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>SoundCloud</strong><strong> </strong><strong>| </strong><strong>Spotify</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Connect with Simona Shao </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Facebook | Instagram | SoundCloud | Spotify</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left\"><strong><em>About GOTTA MOVE&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>GOTTA MOVE is a record label set in motion by Insomniac Music Group in 2025, founded upon the core belief that movement is the only way forward.

Pushing every element to its limit, Watson sustains the stripped-back earmworm for over seven minutes with constant tweaks, percussive switch-ups, and subtle effects that lock you in. ‘A66’, while built around a stripped-back palette, goes further in terms of musicality &#8211; with key changes and cascading synth strings providing an unforgettable, rave-infused hook. Closer ‘A56’ takes cues from both of its predecessors, with melody and movement front and centre for maximum peak-time effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Amorphic’s ‘Resonations Part II’ is released on Symbolism on&nbsp;<strong>5th December.</strong><br /><br />Tracklist:<br />1 &#8211; Amorphic &#8211; A85 &#8211; Symbolism<br />2 &#8211; Amorphic &#8211; A66 &#8211; Symbolism<br />3 &#8211; Amorphic &#8211; A56 &#8211; Symbolism&nbsp;<br /><br />Socials:<br /><strong>Artist</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/vincewatson_official/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/vincewatson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/amorphicofficial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3GQLu8d64ojzLVdMdyaUj3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Spotify</a><br /><strong>Label</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hardgrooverecs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ben-sims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Soundcloud</a>&nbsp;&#8211;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.beatport.com/label/symbolism/88046?srsltid=AfmBOorB3Szd2_fKjQCaMjAkriNxiePjirw3LvH4izC-kZE9T3G8hYEB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Beatport</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/vince-watsons-amorphic-project-drops-resonations-part-ii/\">Vince Watson’s Amorphic project drops ‘Resonations Part II&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

They&#8217;ve just shared six of the acts slated to perform at <strong>Downsview Park</strong> on next year&#8217;s phase one mainstage lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most topical among them is undoubtedly <strong>Mau P</strong>, a tech house mainstay who started dominating festival lineups after the COVID pandemic drew to a close. Fans can look forward to hearing hits like &#8220;Drugs From Amsterdam&#8221; and &#8220;BEATS FOR THE UNDERGROUND&#8221; strung together in a way that only he can concoct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The remainder of the VELD Music Festival 2026 phase one mainstage lineup consists of  artists who broke through during previous dance music eras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Catering to trance and progressive fans are <strong>Armin van Buuren </strong>and <strong>Above &amp; Beyond</strong>, both of whom broke through around the turn of the millennium. The former artist runs the wildly successful <strong>A State Of Trance</strong> and <strong>Armada Music</strong> brands, and the latter trio own <strong>Anjunabeats</strong> as well as its manifold label imprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also billed to perform at VELD Music Festival are <strong>deadmau5</strong> and <strong>Kaskade</strong> under their <strong>Kx5</strong> project. Their collaboration, &#8220;I Remember&#8221; — which came out in 2008 as each of their stars began to rise — clearly wasn&#8217;t enough. Under their new joint alias, the two artists have delivered crowd pleasers like &#8220;Escape&#8221; and &#8220;Bright Lights&#8221; in addition to performing together at festivals worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, <strong>FISHER</strong> and <strong>Illenium</strong> round out the lineup, and they both grew famous at the tail end of the EDM explosion of 2010-2015. But while Illenium gained traction for his poppy fusion of future bass and melodic dubstep, FISHER is best known for releasing tech house anthems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tickets to VELD Music Festival 2026 go on sale Thursday, November 27 at 10am ET.

Matador has been refining his approach to melody and structure for years, and the new release shows how much intention he brings into every detail. Kyozo has been pushing forward with his own run of strong collaborations, which creates a natural point of connection between the two producers.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/48xcGDPQcivvwVpW0Y7kvO?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>The Easy Up title track leans into subtle tension, patient movement, and tightly shaped percussion. Another Level brings a sharper edge and a direct pulse. The release feels like two sides of the same mindset, built with different energy levels but shaped by the same focus on clarity. Both cuts come from long hours in the studio, and both reflect two artists who pay close attention to environment, workflow, and personal momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give producers a closer look at the mindset behind his creative process, we asked Matador about the moments when output starts to feel repetitive and the ways he resets his ear. His answers give a direct view into how he approaches longevity, curiosity, and recovery inside a career that never slows down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you ever hit a stretch where nothing felt fresh anymore?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"703\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.00-PM-1024x703.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82618\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.00-PM-1024x703.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.00-PM-300x206.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.00-PM-768x527.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.00-PM.jpg 1292w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes of course, you can usually see the signs, using similar sounds, completing tracks in record time without really feeling that emotionally attached to them, inspiration dwindling….. All the signs of an overused formula. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this point I would usually take some time away from the studio, watch lots of old synth films, plenty of time outdoors listening to nothing, sleeping plenty, then when I feel ready for the studio again, I’ll set up some different synths, drum machines, outboard, and develop somewhat of a new formula. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has kept me steady for nearly 20 years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What usually helps you get your ear back when producing starts to feel forced?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"605\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.15-PM-1024x605.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82619\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.15-PM-1024x605.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.15-PM-300x177.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.15-PM-768x454.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.15-PM-1536x907.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-19-at-2.06.15-PM.jpg 1752w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, a new piece of equipment can be the most powerful tool to get you back in the game. This has often pushed me to go in new directions and a surge in productivity usually comes with that. Collaboration has also been a big part of my work over the past 2 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve worked with some incredible singer/songwriters and have learned lots of new things outside of my usual purview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you take time away from music in those moments, or do you just write in a different direction?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I mentioned earlier, it’s essential to take time away from the studio/music space, get perspective and come back with fresh ears and hopefully some fresh ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is there anything outside of music that helps you reset your curiosity?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of things, one thing I find a lot of inspiration in is older movies from the late 70’s through to the mid-nineties, great stories, amazing soundtracks, and real explosions!! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I listen to old mixes and dj sets, and live recordings from bands and artists I love.

From there, the tour will hit Philadelphia’s The Ave, Virginia Beach’s Peabody’s, and Minneapolis’ Fillmore before weaving through Houston, Spokane, and Seattle’s WAMU. A massive night awaits at New York City’s Webster Hall on March 14, followed by a heavy dose of bass in Denver, Chicago, Pontiac, Fort Lauderdale, Tampa, and Portland.

Out now on Monstercat, the single adds another standout chapter to [IVY]’s fast-accelerating global momentum as she continues shaping the next wave of the genre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Devotion” wastes no time building atmosphere, opening with a swirl of icy pads and Adalaide’s ethereal top line. The track moves with intention, pulling listeners into a cinematic rise before collapsing into a heavy drum and bass drop driven by punchy percussion and a pulsing low end. The contrast between Adalaide’s soaring vocal performance and [IVY]’s razor-sharp production creates a dynamic push and pull that gives the track both emotional depth and explosive energy. It is a record built for peak festival moments while still holding onto the intimate storytelling that defines great vocal DnB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"[IVY] - Devotion (feat.

Throughout this release cycle, she has emphasized her goal of bridging nostalgia and modern production, a vision that “Devotion” captures with striking clarity. After road-testing the track throughout the summer, she watched it become one of her strongest crowd reactions of the year, further solidifying its role as a key addition to her catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release crowns a milestone year for [IVY], following major records such as “To The Limit,” “Flow,” and her collaboration “Can’t Love Me” with A Little Sound. Her touring schedule has been equally relentless, with recent runs across New Zealand and Australia supporting drum and bass legend Andy C. Through 2025 she has continued expanding across the UK, Europe, and Asia, with appearances at Butlins, Forge, Beaverworks, Tilburg, Creamfields Thailand, and Maassilo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"[IVY] &amp; A Little Sound - Can&#039;t Love Me [UKF Release]\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4waehYAY6qM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year also marks the introduction of her new alias [SAFYRE], a project dedicated to exploring her techno foundation. The first release under the new name reimagined the Black Eyed Peas’ “Rock That Body” into a trance-driven club weapon, signaling an exciting new dimension to her artistry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in rural Brittany, [IVY] has risen from underground promise to global recognition, performing at festivals like EDC Las Vegas, Tomorrowland, Glastonbury, and Boomtown. Adalaide Adams continues to elevate her profile as one of electronic music’s most expressive vocalists, adding emotional weight to every collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With “Devotion,” both artists deliver a powerful statement piece that blends emotion, nostalgia, and dancefloor intensity into a single unforgettable moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IVY-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82561\" style=\"width:521px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IVY-1-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IVY-1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IVY-1-768x960.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IVY-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><em>FOLLOW [IVY]:</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ivywubs/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> INSTAGRAM</em></a><em> | </em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3bXszy3HMRqUhnON4Bpojw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SPOTIFY</em></a><em> | </em><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/ivywubs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SOUNDCLOUD</em></a> <em>| </em><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@ivydnb?lang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>TIKTOK</em></a><em> | </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ivywubs/videos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>YOUTUBE</em></a></h4>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><br><strong><em>FOLLOW ADALAIDE ADAMS:</em></strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/adalaideadams/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em> INSTAGRAM</em></a><em> | </em><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/2DPd9FRFSPPDdESOqZvWoC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>SPOTIFY</em></a></h4>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/ivy-adalaide-adams-devotion/\">[IVY] And Adalaide Adams Drop Drum &amp; Bass Anthem &#8216;Devotion&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

After his well-received full-length &#8220;Oktopus Mekaniks&#8221; established him in underground club circuits, this new release refines his unique approach &#8211; sampling his own acoustic drum kit, sequencing it digitally, and essentially creating a &#8220;shortcut between the computer and himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead single &#8220;Shortcut Jenny&#8221; perfectly demonstrates this hybrid POV. Built around hunting-horn samples (courtesy of a friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s obscure record) and VAAGUE&#8217;s own voice, the track evolved from a happy accident &#8211; a digital synth preset that accidentally dropped pitch became the massive bass drop that anchors the UK Garage groove. Jennifer Lawrence interview snippets provide texture without imposing meaning, letting listeners create their own narrative. It&#8217;s the kind of innovative production approach you&#8217;d expect from someone who spent years mastering jazz before diving into electronic music from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes VAAGUE&#8217;s trajectory compelling is how completely he&#8217;s committed to this electronic persona. Starting with downtempo experiments on his 2021 self-titled EP, collaborating with Le Motel on 2022&#8217;s dancefloor-focused &#8220;From the Ashes,&#8221; and now fully embracing faster tempos and live playability on &#8220;SHORTCUT,&#8221; he&#8217;s methodically building a unique sonic identity. His background as a jazz bandleader informs everything &#8211; the complex choreography of his live stick performances, the compositional sophistication underlying even his most club-ready tracks. &#8220;SHORTCUT&#8221; proves the detour through jazz was actually the most direct route to somewhere genuinely original.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2KfrQENbQ6yI3Hmiki9iKy?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/401707/\">VAAGUE Teases Boundary-pushing EP with Lead Single &#8216;Shortcut Jenny&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

For me, seeing the growth Sage (<a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=Devault\">Devault</a>) has made over the years has been nothing short of inspiring. From moody remixes that first caught fire online to commanding festival stages across the world, he’s carved his own lane—one defined by emotion, texture, and experience.</p>\n<p>Now, with “Feels Like Us,” released via John Summit’s commanding record label, Experts Only, Devault steps into a new era. The track blends nostalgic melodies with futuristic sound design. The chords keep you locked in, but the topline leaves us wanting more. It’s the kind of record that feels like late-night city lights and open highways, balancing introspection with release.</p>\n<p>Teased by John Summit at Experts Only Festival in NYC and Austin City Limits, the track has already stirred massive anticipation. Devault, known for drawing from Depeche Mode and Daft Punk, continues to refine his signature blend of dark energy and modern elegance—proving once again that emotion and innovation can coexist beautifully.</p>\n<p>“Feels Like Us” isn’t just another drop—it’s a statement.

Another reminder that no one does high-tech minimal quite like Boris. <em>– Danielle Carty</em></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2tj1iOLK9Uwef7ooLgJMtJ?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/zenith/pl.u-38oWMM4FPbPMamB\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iammaesic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maesic</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/10/dancing-astronauts-new-music-friday-maesic-boris-brejcha-dimension-and-more-october-31-2025/\">Dancing Astronaut’s New Music Friday: Maesic, Boris Brejcha, Dimension, and more (October 31, 2025)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

The world-renowned electronic producer has announced his first full-length studio album in nearly a decade. This is massive news for the newcomers and the seasoned dance music goers. The album is set for release in 2026. Kicking off this long-awaited new era, he drops “Ameonna”, a lush, cinematic instrumental out today via his <a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=mau5trap\">mau5trap</a> label.</p>\n<p>Building from shimmering atmospherics to an electrified storm of synths, “Ameonna” evokes the raw precision and texture that made deadmau5 a household name with tracks like “Faxing Berlin” and “Some Chords.” It’s both nostalgic and forward-looking — a sonic bridge between his legacy and his next chapter.</p>\n<p>But that’s not all. deadmau5 is officially retiring his iconic Cube production and debuting an entirely new live show this November 7 &#038; 8 at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. The five-hour set will feature his techno alter-ego testpilot, new music from the upcoming album, and even a mau5 drum &amp; bass segment to close out the night — all wrapped in cutting-edge visuals and fresh stage design.</p>\n<p>To celebrate, Denver will host a two-day mau5hop pop-up at 95 S Cherokee Street, open from 5 a.m. to 7 p.m. Fans can grab exclusive merch, including hoodies, vinyl, hats, and even a limited Atari x deadmau5 “Meowingtons’ Revenge” playable cartridge. deadmau5 himself will be there for meet-and-greets each day from noon to 3 p.m. Entry is free and open to all ages.</p>\n<p>With “Ameonna,” a new album on the horizon, and a fresh live experience about to debut, deadmau5 isn’t just returning — he’s reinventing.</p>\n<p>deadmau5 &#8211; Ameonna |</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2184808187&#038;color=%23cc0000&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true\"></iframe></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" title=\"deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deadmau5</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5/ameonna\" title=\"Ameonna\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ameonna</a></div>\n<p>“Follow” deadmau5 : | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=1fe640-1-1721663343551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=561c75-1-1721663343551\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soundcloud</a> |</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/2025/10/deadmau5-new-single-ameonna-new-album-new-red-rocks-show/\">deadmau5 Is Back: New Single “Ameonna,” New Album, New Red Rocks Show</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com\">thissongslaps.com - Electronic Dance Music &amp; Hip-Hop Media</a>.</p>\n",

Joel Zimmerman, better known by his electronic dance music moniker, <a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=deadmau5\">deadmau5</a>, delivered a five-hour sonic journey that reminded everyone why he’s one of electronic music’s most inventive minds. From blistering techno as <a href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/?s=Testpilot\">Testpilot</a> to high-energy drum &#038; bass as DnB Mau5, every moment felt intentional, immersive, and alive.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-4.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"929\" height=\"601\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221414\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-4.jpg 929w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-4-300x194.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-4-768x497.jpg 768w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-4-95x60.jpg 95w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 929px) 100vw, 929px\" /></center></p>\n<p>Before the show, we stopped by the mau5shop pop-up just south of the Denver City Center. The line for the meet and greet was massive, so we skipped that part and waited in the merch line instead — and it was *so worth it.* Hidden behind what looked like a laundry room was a secret passageway leading into the merch area, where a giant Meowingtons blow-up greeted fans. The two “Day of the Dead” mau5 helmets were on display, and seeing them up close was unreal. There was no shortcuts taken in the fabrication of these helmets. </p>\n<p>The merch itself was next-level. Compared to the Red Rocks booth, this pop-up had far better selections and exclusives. I grabbed the deadmau5 letterman jacket, while my friend picked up a hoodie and shirt. The designs were clean, bold, and collector-worthy — a reminder not to miss the next pop-up event.</p>\n<p>Back at Red Rocks, the night kicked off right on schedule.</p>\n<p>Testpilot wasted no time tearing up the decks from 6:00 to 7:30. Joel came out in a hat instead of the helmet, locked in from the first beat. The set was dark, mechanical, and full of drive. Figure humanoids appeared on stage throughout, adding to the otherworldly vibe as the sun dipped behind the rocks.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"925\" height=\"593\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221413\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3.jpg 925w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3-300x192.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3-768x492.jpg 768w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-3-95x60.jpg 95w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" /></center></p>\n<p>At 7:30, DEATHPIXIE took over — the first virtual artist ever signed to a major dance label. Her set was visually stunning and full of energy, especially with the addition of three live dancers. They gave the production a human element that helped bridge the digital and real worlds. It was unlike anything I’d seen at a mau5trap show before.</p>\n<p>Then, from 8:00 to 10:20, it was time for the main event. Deadmau5 returned to the stage, transitioning seamlessly from Testpilot’s grit to his signature cinematic sound. He dropped a brand-new unreleased track — easily one of the best of the night — and while I was hoping for “Monophobia,” it’s hard to complain with a catalog this deep. “Strobe” was a crowd favorite as always, and his collab with Kaskade, “Escape,” sent the entire amphitheater into pure chaos.</p>\n<p>Skylar Grey made a surprise appearance midway through, dressed in all red and completely owning the stage. Her live vocals on “My Heart Has Teeth” and “Let You Lie” with DEATHPIXIE gave the night a haunting, powerful touch.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"933\" height=\"595\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221415\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5.jpg 933w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5-300x191.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5-768x490.jpg 768w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-5-95x60.jpg 95w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 933px) 100vw, 933px\" /></center></p>\n<p>By the time the DnB Mau5 set started around 10:20, the energy was off the charts. It didn’t lean into the muddy UK grime style — instead, it kept that clean, polished deadmau5 texture. The transitions were flawless, the basslines sharp. You could tell Joel was in complete flow state. Around an hour and a half into the main set, something shifted — he stopped performing *at* the music and started performing *through* it.</p>\n<p>As the final track faded and lights dimmed, Joel grabbed the mic and said this was one of his top 10 sets ever. And I believe it. The crowd, the visuals, the sound — everything clicked in a way that felt timeless.</p>\n<p>It was an honor to photograph this show and capture a night that was pure artistry in motion. Huge thanks to Alex Greenberg and the entire deadmau5 team for the hospitality. This one will be hard to top.</p>\n<p><center><img src=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2.jpg\" alt=\"deadmau5 red rocks\" width=\"935\" height=\"623\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-221412\" srcset=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2.jpg 935w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.thissongslaps.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-red-rocks-thissongslaps-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px\" /></center></p>\n<p>“Follow” deadmau5 : | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=1fe640-1-1721663343551\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fdeadmau5%2F&#038;token=561c75-1-1721663343551\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/deadmau5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Soundcloud</a> |</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com/2025/11/day-of-the-deadmau5-at-red-rocks/\">A New Era Has Begun As Day Of The deadmau5 Makes History At Red Rocks</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.thissongslaps.com\">thissongslaps.com - Electronic Dance Music &amp; Hip-Hop Media</a>.</p>\n",
