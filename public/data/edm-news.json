After his well-received full-length &#8220;Oktopus Mekaniks&#8221; established him in underground club circuits, this new release refines his unique approach &#8211; sampling his own acoustic drum kit, sequencing it digitally, and essentially creating a &#8220;shortcut between the computer and himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead single &#8220;Shortcut Jenny&#8221; perfectly demonstrates this hybrid POV. Built around hunting-horn samples (courtesy of a friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s obscure record) and VAAGUE&#8217;s own voice, the track evolved from a happy accident &#8211; a digital synth preset that accidentally dropped pitch became the massive bass drop that anchors the UK Garage groove. Jennifer Lawrence interview snippets provide texture without imposing meaning, letting listeners create their own narrative. It&#8217;s the kind of innovative production approach you&#8217;d expect from someone who spent years mastering jazz before diving into electronic music from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes VAAGUE&#8217;s trajectory compelling is how completely he&#8217;s committed to this electronic persona. Starting with downtempo experiments on his 2021 self-titled EP, collaborating with Le Motel on 2022&#8217;s dancefloor-focused &#8220;From the Ashes,&#8221; and now fully embracing faster tempos and live playability on &#8220;SHORTCUT,&#8221; he&#8217;s methodically building a unique sonic identity. His background as a jazz bandleader informs everything &#8211; the complex choreography of his live stick performances, the compositional sophistication underlying even his most club-ready tracks. &#8220;SHORTCUT&#8221; proves the detour through jazz was actually the most direct route to somewhere genuinely original.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2KfrQENbQ6yI3Hmiki9iKy?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/401707/\">VAAGUE Teases Boundary-pushing EP with Lead Single &#8216;Shortcut Jenny&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

A moment between the end and the beginning, new and old. The pause between heartbeats, between night and day. A mixture of hope and nostalgia, anxiety and delight.&#8221; &#8211; MANOID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album was created entirely on hardware synthesizers, including Elektron, Waldorf, and modular systems, giving the ten-track record a cohesive, tactile character. Each track is accompanied by a written story, often drawn from childhood memories, that reflects the moments of vulnerability, wonder, and reflection explored in the music. From the atmospheric depth of ‘Time Capsule (Voyager)’ to the cosmic imagination of ‘Lajka’ and liquid percussion in ‘Fate Line’, MANOID tells tales through expert sound design. For tracks like the evocative ‘Love Letter’, dream-like ‘Moonsong’, and fast-paced ‘Bliss’, MANOID is joined by Polish performance and audiovisual artist Milkbaby, whose work spans the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw and Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin. Her powerful, raw, and emotive vocals bring the album’s narrative to life, culminating in a rich and varied oﬀering that is perfect for deep listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in eastern Poland near the last primeval forest in Europe, MANOID has performed across Poland and internationally, appearing at Tauron Nowa Muzyka, Audioriver, and Boiler Room x Instytut, among others. He is also the founder of Instytut Dźwięku, Poland’s leading school for club music, and co-founder of the holyklang label, which focuses on forward-thinking electronic music that explores the relationship between sound, emotion, and precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">MANOID ‘I_N_T_E_R_V_A_L_S&#8217; releases via holyklang 14th November 2025</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Tracklist</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">01 Time Capsule (Voyager)<br />02 Timefall<br />03 Love Letter (ft.

After his well-received full-length &#8220;Oktopus Mekaniks&#8221; established him in underground club circuits, this new release refines his unique approach &#8211; sampling his own acoustic drum kit, sequencing it digitally, and essentially creating a &#8220;shortcut between the computer and himself.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lead single &#8220;Shortcut Jenny&#8221; perfectly demonstrates this hybrid POV. Built around hunting-horn samples (courtesy of a friend&#8217;s father&#8217;s obscure record) and VAAGUE&#8217;s own voice, the track evolved from a happy accident &#8211; a digital synth preset that accidentally dropped pitch became the massive bass drop that anchors the UK Garage groove. Jennifer Lawrence interview snippets provide texture without imposing meaning, letting listeners create their own narrative. It&#8217;s the kind of innovative production approach you&#8217;d expect from someone who spent years mastering jazz before diving into electronic music from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes VAAGUE&#8217;s trajectory compelling is how completely he&#8217;s committed to this electronic persona. Starting with downtempo experiments on his 2021 self-titled EP, collaborating with Le Motel on 2022&#8217;s dancefloor-focused &#8220;From the Ashes,&#8221; and now fully embracing faster tempos and live playability on &#8220;SHORTCUT,&#8221; he&#8217;s methodically building a unique sonic identity. His background as a jazz bandleader informs everything &#8211; the complex choreography of his live stick performances, the compositional sophistication underlying even his most club-ready tracks. &#8220;SHORTCUT&#8221; proves the detour through jazz was actually the most direct route to somewhere genuinely original.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2KfrQENbQ6yI3Hmiki9iKy?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/11/401707/\">VAAGUE Teases Boundary-pushing EP with Lead Single &#8216;Shortcut Jenny&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

A moment between the end and the beginning, new and old. The pause between heartbeats, between night and day. A mixture of hope and nostalgia, anxiety and delight.&#8221; &#8211; MANOID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The album was created entirely on hardware synthesizers, including Elektron, Waldorf, and modular systems, giving the ten-track record a cohesive, tactile character. Each track is accompanied by a written story, often drawn from childhood memories, that reflects the moments of vulnerability, wonder, and reflection explored in the music. From the atmospheric depth of ‘Time Capsule (Voyager)’ to the cosmic imagination of ‘Lajka’ and liquid percussion in ‘Fate Line’, MANOID tells tales through expert sound design. For tracks like the evocative ‘Love Letter’, dream-like ‘Moonsong’, and fast-paced ‘Bliss’, MANOID is joined by Polish performance and audiovisual artist Milkbaby, whose work spans the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw and Fondazione Sandretto Re Rebaudengo in Turin. Her powerful, raw, and emotive vocals bring the album’s narrative to life, culminating in a rich and varied oﬀering that is perfect for deep listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in eastern Poland near the last primeval forest in Europe, MANOID has performed across Poland and internationally, appearing at Tauron Nowa Muzyka, Audioriver, and Boiler Room x Instytut, among others. He is also the founder of Instytut Dźwięku, Poland’s leading school for club music, and co-founder of the holyklang label, which focuses on forward-thinking electronic music that explores the relationship between sound, emotion, and precision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">MANOID ‘I_N_T_E_R_V_A_L_S&#8217; releases via holyklang 14th November 2025</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">Tracklist</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\">01 Time Capsule (Voyager)<br />02 Timefall<br />03 Love Letter (ft.

      "fullContent": "\n<p><a href=\"https://www.songscription.ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Songscription</a> secured a $5M funding round led by Reach Capital, setting the stage for its next phase of development. The company is building an AI platform that converts audio into accurate sheet music, tabs, and MIDI within seconds, giving musicians direct access to notation for any song they want to study or perform. The new round includes participation from Emerge Capital, 10x Founders, Dent Capital, and a group of angel investors that includes former Guns N’ Roses guitarist Ron “Bumblefoot” Thal, who also advises the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company’s focus is simple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most musicians cannot easily locate notation for the tracks they want to learn, and the gap has widened as streaming platforms make countless niche artists available to global listeners. Songscription addresses that gap with a transcription engine that captures melody and performance detail for piano, violin, guitar, bass guitar, trumpet, and flute. Additional instruments are already in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>AI Transcription for Real-World Learning</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.15-PM-1024x517.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82429\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.15-PM-1024x517.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.15-PM-300x152.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.15-PM-768x388.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.15-PM-1536x776.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.20.15-PM.jpg 1821w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Songscription’s co-founders</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Users upload an audio file, and Songscription’s system produces notation and MIDI that mirror the original performance. The platform supports direct editing inside the browser, along with a piano roll for users who prefer a DAW-style view. This gives learners a practical way to study arrangements that previously had no documentation available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Training data comes from three sources: public domain material, partnerships with artists, and agreements with music businesses. The company is also working with global publishers to expand the variety and accuracy of its datasets. Advisors note that ethical licensing is a priority, and the team continues to pursue clear pathways that support rights holders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A New Tool for Songwriters and Ensemble Musicians</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Improvised ideas often disappear as quickly as they arrive. Songscription positions its platform as a way to preserve those moments by converting audio from a session into notation that can be referenced and shared. This feature has practical value for songwriters, producers, and musicians who collaborate across locations. The team is also building full-ensemble transcription, which will allow bands to capture and study multi-instrument arrangements from a single recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Early users include educators, players studying complex repertoire, and working musicians who want a faster way to document their own catalog. Adoption has already reached more than 150,000 users across 150 countries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new funding, Songscription will expand its supported instruments, refine its notation export tools, and continue development on an interactive learning system that provides performance feedback in real time. The long-term aim is to create a platform that gives musicians clear, accurate instruction for any song they want to learn on any instrument.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/songscription-secures-5m-to-push-ai-music-transcription-forward/\">Songscription Secures $5M to Push AI Music Transcription Forward</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The B1 Bass Synthesizer, L1 Monophonic Synthesizer, and D1 Drum Machine will all be on display, along with the Ruben Wan signature pedals and the Triple Threat pedal created with Third Man Hardware.

Donner’s booth is located on the second floor of the main exhibition hall. Modular Commune is designed for creators who want a deeper look at electronic hardware workflows, from signal routing to real-time performance, and the environment encourages direct interaction with both instruments and the people behind them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the highlights of the weekend is Donner’s workshop, which focuses on taking a basic idea and expanding it into a complete acid electro arrangement. Lin Feng and Gan Lai will walk through their process using the ESSENTIAL series. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The session covers their approach to sequencing, sound selection, and arrangement, giving newer producers a practical look at how to move from sketch to full track.

What started nearly three decades ago with photocopied flyers and a commandeered Kinko’s now brings global legends and underground heroes together under one roof at The Masquerade. Founded in 1998 by Brandon Couturier and MJ Lee, the festival continues to expand without losing the raw, community-driven energy that built it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FRIDAY DECEMBER 12 AND SATURDAY DECEMBER 13 TICKETS ON SALE NOW  <a href=\"https://junglebells.org/presents/junglebells2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s edition on December 12 and 13 brings more than 70 artists across four stages, pairing pioneers like Roni Size and Dillinja with new-school favorites such as Bou, Goddard, and Andromedik. The team has also announced official afterhours events benefiting the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, keeping the bass rolling well past sunrise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this conversation, Jungle Bells co-founder Brandon Couturier reflects on the origins of the festival, the long-standing partnership that powers it, and how authenticity continues to shape its future.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5Hn55fKRrFBkn4KavWQZZ2?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interview with Jungle Bells Co-Founder Brandon Couturier</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Origin: From Kinko’s to Culture Hub</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve joked that Jungle Bells was ‘born in a Kinko’s.’ Can you share what that first renegade event was like — and how it evolved into one of North America’s most respected drum &amp; bass festivals? Can you take us back to that first moment — what was happening in Atlanta’s scene then, and how did that night spark what would become Jungle Bells?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our first show wasn’t technically a Jungle Bells. It was more of a break-beat-style party. MJ had a friend who owned a sandwich shop, and the two of them decided to, umm, &#8220;commandeer&#8221; the Kinkos next door for a late-night renegade. MJ talked me into helping out, and that’s how our great friendship began. The first official Jungle Bells happened the following December in an after-hours warehouse we used to throw parties in all the time. MJ was out of town on business in LA, so I was left in charge. There was a guy named Darcy throwing DnB/Jungle nights in Athens, GA, and that totally inspired me to try something similar in Atlanta. What better time than now, right? We only had a week to promote it. There was no social media then&#8230; just pounding pavement with photocopied flyers, but somehow the event went off. MJ got back from LA about two hours into the night and instantly fell in love with the sound. Hard to believe that 27 years later, MJ, Darcy, and I are all now partners and still doing what we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Partnership Dynamic</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.17-AM-1024x551.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82399\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.17-AM-1024x551.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.17-AM-300x161.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.17-AM-768x413.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.17-AM.jpg 1530w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve been doing this together for more than two decades. What’s the key to keeping a creative partnership strong — and how do your personalities or strengths balance each other out when things get intense and when it comes to vision, logistics, and keeping the spirit of the event alive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MJ and I have been friends forever, through the rough stuff and the good times. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve always shared this wild imagination for what’s possible in our little world. MJ’s got a real gift for hyping what’s hot right now, and I’ve somehow developed this knack for putting together lineups that end up being two-years ahead of the curve. These days, I bounce ideas off MJ and Darcy about what we think will make the best experience for everyone. Not just us, but for the community and the scene. The three of us work great together because we couldn’t be more different, and that’s exactly what makes it click. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do weekly meetings to keep our vision for Jungle Bells on track. It’s part planning session, part comedy hour. At the end of the day, though, we’re just really close friends who look out for each other and the family of friends we&#8217;re blessed to have supporting our vision. Without the community, all our ideas would stay that way… just ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balancing Legends and the Next Wave</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s lineup pairs genre pioneers like Roni Size and Dillinja with rising innovators such as Bou, Goddard, and Andromedik. What’s your philosophy when curating a bill that honors the roots but also moves the sound forward?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been part of the DnB/Jungle scene since 1998, so this isn’t just something we do… it’s something we love. It’s in our blood at this point. All of us feel it’s important to bring the classics, legends, and pioneers back into the spotlight for the new generation of fans. At the same time, we want the old-school heads to catch the energy of the newer artists who are pushing the sound forward. In the end, it’s all about connecting people through good music, no matter when they joined the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advice for Emerging Artists</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.26-AM-1024x587.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82400\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.26-AM-1024x587.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.26-AM-300x172.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.26-AM-768x440.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.26-AM-1536x880.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.26-AM.jpg 1551w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From your perspective as promoters, what can up-and-coming artists do to make a lasting impression — not just musically, but in how they build relationships and show professionalism behind the scenes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be humble. Always remember that the community and the fans are what make you, and stay true to your heart. If you’re genuinely feeling what you’re doing, the crowd will feel it too. You can’t fake that kind of energy and, if you try, you&#8217;ll get caught. We look for talented, positive people who have that spark &#8211; the ones who really believe in what they’re doing. We’re lucky to have our partner, Darcy Reenis, who hosts a bi-monthly event in Atlanta called Torch, where a ton of upcoming talent gets the chance to perform. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to be part of the scene, then get involved in the scene. Support others and they&#8217;ll support you. At the end of the day, just be you and believe in what you do. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That level of passion is a beacon.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Community and Authenticity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve said that people are craving the underground again — that real, sweaty, no-BS energy. What does authenticity mean to you in 2025, and how do you keep that spirit alive while still growing year after year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, it’s all about keeping things positive, inviting, and focused on the community experience. Jungle Bells has always felt more like an annual family reunion than just another festival. We try to bring the more well-known, large-room talent that doesn&#8217;t tour through our area often. Rather than see them play in a large, impersonal field, we host a more underground, small-room experience. It&#8217;s not just for the fans, but for the artists too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are as part of this family as everyone else and love it. Sure, it can get a little crowded at times, but we do our best to manage that and never oversell the space. 2025 is shaping up to be one of our most ambitious Jungle Bells yet with about 70 artists on the line-up. Instead of expanding to a new venue and losing the underground spirit, we expanded to two nights while investing more in next-level talent, stage production, sound. Our venue, The Masquerade, has hosted us for decades. They&#8217;re family too.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Atlanta is known as a hip-hop capital, yet Jungle Bells has carved out a respected D&amp;B hub. How has community and authenticity played into your growth, and what should artists keep in mind when they’re building a brand in a genre that’s increasingly commercial?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"673\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.35-AM-1024x673.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82401\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.35-AM-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.35-AM-300x197.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.35-AM-768x505.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-8.02.35-AM.jpg 1451w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Atlanta has been the home of lots of amazing music over the years and known for putting the South on the map with artists like Outkast to the days of TLC. We’re blessed to work with a ton of Hip Hop producers over the years. I feel like any music can become commercial with the right amount of attention so we would tell any artist or promoter: Just keep it real.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Family, Legacy, and What’s Next</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ve described Jungle Bells as a family reunion — for artists, fans, and friends from all over the world. What keeps you inspired to keep building this culture, and what’s next for Jungle Bells beyond Atlanta?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jungle Bells never started as anything more than a gathering. It just grew over the years because fans keep bringing new friends to share the vibes. I know it sounds a little silly, but we’ve actually received hearts from fans who say the vibe reminds them of the old Winter Music Conference days, before Ultra took over. We like to think that if you’ve worked to pay to attend or play at our event, it better be something special. What’s next for us is doing some different events around the US using our formula, because we want to bring Jungle Bells to the fans where they live. The way we see it, MJ will always be out front, greeting fans and thanking them for coming. Not many promoters have that kind of energy anymore. Darcy and I stay busy on the tactical side and DJ ourselves so we’re right there in the mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we decide on which cities in North America will get shows in 2026, our fans will hear about it first. We stay connected with them because we want to make sure they know how much we love them.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/how-jungle-bells-became-north-americas-underground-db-powerhouse/\">How Jungle Bells Became North America’s Underground D&amp;B Powerhouse</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

Heart-stirring stunner <strong>‘God In You’</strong> is out now on <strong>Remember the Future/[PIAS].</strong> Hero&#8217;s emotional powerful voice, resistless dub techno/90s electronic synth chord stabs, jumping breakbeat, upbeat percussion all multi-layered with bags of reverb.

Hero’s haunting, emotionally powerful voice is allied to portentous. This portrayal makes the message easy to grasp. Hero says, &#8220;<em>The idea of a ‘god in you’ isn’t literal, but about recognizing that we are made of everything the universe holds&#8230;</em>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>&#8220;The track is inspired by the poet/mystic Rumi, a 13th-century philosopher whose words on love, divinity, and the human spirit still feel timeless&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Hero Baldwin</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;<em>The magic, the vastness, the light, it’s all already within us. This song is about making the conscious choice, every day, to reach for the extraordinary.

Teased by Summit during his Experts Only Festival in New York and later at Austin City Limits, the track arrived in live sets first as an attention-grabbing ID that immediately ignited online chatter and fan clips. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/94f862db-6ca5-420a-ac5d-679c7ca04611.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"590\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/94f862db-6ca5-420a-ac5d-679c7ca04611.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392120\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/94f862db-6ca5-420a-ac5d-679c7ca04611.webp 590w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/94f862db-6ca5-420a-ac5d-679c7ca04611-300x205.webp 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/94f862db-6ca5-420a-ac5d-679c7ca04611-218x150.webp 218w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>&#8216;Feels Like Us&#8217; blends a nostalgic 2010s style melody with Devault&#8217;s signature snappy, futuristic design. The track delivers plenty of cinematic emotion and a vibrant, euphoric drop that pushes the tune from introspective to ecstatic. The record’s production balances melancholic synth textures with a propulsive beat, giving it energy that translates perfectly for a hands-in-the-air, fireworks flying moment at a festival mainstage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Devault (the stage name of Sage DeVault), this single is the latest step in a steadily developing arc. Known for moody, genre-blurring production work that channels the dark romanticism of Depeche Mode, combined with the polished futurism of Daft Punk, he’s built a reputation through high-profile performances at Coachella, EDC, and a sold-out U.S. tour. Over the years, he&#8217;s transformed his persona from an underground remixer to a headline-capable producer who fuses emotional storytelling with dynamics tuned for the club floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Releasing on Experts Only feels right, as the imprint has become a launchpad for tech house and techno-leaning records that have both dancefloor momentum and viral reach. With &#8216;Feels Like Us&#8217;, Devault puts forth a confident statement that will cement his place in the ecosystem as a name to watch out for going into 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Feels Like Us\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/23Hxd8ph2vJWlXngubtyuO?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/devault-feels-like-us/\">Devault Drops Emotion-Fueled Banger &#8216;Feels Like Us&#8217;</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

What began years ago as a curiosity about fluid simulations has evolved into something far more personal: a way to continue exploring the kinetic beauty he used to capture on long outdoor photography trips, now rebuilt through real-time algorithms inside Unreal Engine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rodrigo Etcheto - 112358 (Official Music Video)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GD4Q20odjm8?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Etcheto talks about visuals the same way some producers talk about synths: color palettes as emotional keys, movement as rhythm, “happy accidents” as creative breakthroughs. And while the videos aren’t required to experience the music, they complete a kind of alternate ecosystem: mellow but energized, hypnotic but never inert, built for living rooms rather than dance floors. He’s crafting an audiovisual pulse for the quiet hours &#8211; music you absorb in a mediative state, visuals that drift between art piece and meditative companion, and all inspired by his curiosity of motion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We sat down with Rodrigo to learn more about how he creates these experiences. Take a listen to &#8220;Everything Flows&#8221;, and read on to learn more about how he&#8217;s able to combine music and visuals to create something far more than the sum of its parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Everything Flows\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2eX9tQX8dEZYvCcIZfkeDi?si=bht98cYHQDKcVdIh_DhmOA&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did you realize that you wanted to build immersive audiovisual worlds, rather than just standalone music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always been very interested in visual arts. I used to spend a lot of time outdoors doing landscape photography for example, but life changed and I don’t have the time for that anymore. I’m always looking for something interesting to do with visuals, I still photograph a lot but I focus more on other things now. Years ago I discovered the possibility of using fluid simulations to make weird flowing canvases and I was instantly hooked. When I used to go out into the forests to take pictures, I would end up photographing water a lot: flowing rivers, waterfalls, waves, etc. There’s something about the motion of liquids that I really love. In photography you can try to show what that motion is with long exposures for example and it creates an interesting image. But when I realized what’s possible with fluid simulations it opened up a new way of exploring that type of motion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Each track on Everything Flows has its own trippy visual language. How do you start that visual process, and decide how each track looks?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I generally start with a color scheme and then start exploring how different types of motion and different sets of colors interact with each other. Some tracks feel more understated to me, so I might choose a simple white/gold color scheme for example. With some tracks I like to explore maybe something very bright or a monochrome look. It’s really just all about experimentation and finding combinations of movement and color that catch my attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Rodrigo Etcheto - The Last Natural Human (Official Music Video)\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/D8rj3gHMQl4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about how you actually made these videos. What software and techniques did you use? Were there any tracks in which the video came before the music?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The videos are all made in Unreal Engine which is a real-time game engine. You can use it for a lot more than that however and I started exploring the possibilities of real-time graphics for visualizations a long time ago. What I like is that when you’re working with real-time algorithms, there are a lot of ‘happy accidents’ or unexpected behaviors that end up looking really cool. It’s similar to what happens when you’re producing music, you need to spend a lot of time experimenting and cool melodies or phrases pop up accidentally.&nbsp; I find this type of experimentation really fun and you end up with imagery that would be really hard to script because you don’t necessarily know what might be possible to create. These simulations are non-linear so there is lots of parameters in the simulations to explore which result in really interesting but unpredictable behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In your eyes, how crucial are the music videos to the entire experience of Everything Flows? Would this project be able to exist without them?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me they are quite separate, but I like to listen to music on a TV myself for example and have some visuals and videos playing. Or sometimes I listen to music on a sound system but maybe put something interesting on mute on a TV. I like to have visuals and music combined, so my intent was to have that option for people like me that also like to have visuals in the background while they listen to something.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rodrigo-Etcheto-3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82391\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rodrigo-Etcheto-3-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rodrigo-Etcheto-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rodrigo-Etcheto-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rodrigo-Etcheto-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Rodrigo-Etcheto-3.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you want listeners to feel when they experience your music and visuals together?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m trying to create something that’s upbeat and has rhythm, but it’s not pure dance music. It’s not meant for a club, it’s for the way I listen to music which is on a sofa reading a book. So I try to create a mellow but still energetic experience and the visuals are another way of creating something hypnotizing. The visuals are hopefully something you can just watch and get into the groove, or have on in the background as art while you enjoy the tracks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lastly, what’s next for you? Are you exploring new mediums, collaborations, or technologies for your next project?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m working on another EP and I have more ideas for different types of visualizations, but always with the theme of fluid motion. I’m trying to create a unique style that will be recognizable. There are lots of incredible tools out there and lots of artists trying interesting things, but for me this is uncharted territory and I think there’s a lot more that I can do with realtime algorithms that sync to nice tracks. I often have a strong visual response to music and I like to imagine what an instrument or beat could look like. I’m having a lot of fun creating these flowing landscapes and there’s a lot more to explore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stream &#8220;Everything Flows&#8221; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2eX9tQX8dEZYvCcIZfkeDi?si=T8ij09lkQMGtNPVlW-G2sg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/rodrigo-etcheto-speaks-on-exploring-motion-through-audiovisual-experiences/\">Rodrigo Etcheto Speaks on Exploring Motion Through Audiovisual Experiences</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

The incisive ‘Riot’ takes aim at systemic sexism in the industry through punishing BPMs and psyched-out field recordings, while ‘Burnout’ plays with distortion and repetition to highlight the pressures of balancing music creation with social media demands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, ‘Girlhood’ – premiering below – deals with the “grief and hopelessness surrounding the loss of a loved one” through&nbsp;live-recorded bells contrasted with her signature dark, driving kicks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“‘Girlhood’ is one of the emotionally heavier tracks on this album,”&nbsp;NLI shared.&nbsp;“I made it in the aftermath of my grandfather passing away, who I remained very close to my whole life. The track itself was made entirely in his study, where I set up all my hardware and laptop as I wished to feel close to him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“[He] was an inspiring figure to me in my life, offering support, wisdom, mentorship and help when I needed it,” she added. “No one believed in me as much as my grandfather and I continue to cherish my memory of him as he lives on in my music.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking on the album as a whole, NLI continued: “‘Initiation’ is a very personal recount of my journey. Each track tells a story about my initiation into techno and music in general, but also shines a light on the struggles many young artists face entering the industry. It’s my sonic autobiography.”</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com/nli-releases-new-album-initiation-via-adhesive/\">NLI releases new album ‘Initiation’ via Adhesive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://findyoursounds.com\">FindYourSounds</a>.</p>\n",

It is a fully realized, polished version of a fan-favorite ID that had been floating around online, known primarily for its appearance in the latter half of his experimental <strong>F*CK U SKRILLEX</strong> album stream under the title <strong>&#8216;ZEET NOISE.&#8217;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the original ID was a raw, percussive techno stomper, the official release takes the core groove and elevates it with the addition of Caroline Polachek&#8217;s <strong>stunning, ethereal vocals.</strong> Her contribution transforms the track, infusing the dark, driving production with a deeply melancholic and haunting lyrical core.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-production-that-hits-hard\">Production That Hits Hard</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Musically, &#8216;hit me where it hurts x&#8217; is a testament to the versatility of Skrillex and Dylan Brady. The production is characterized by a crisp, <strong>punchy kick drum</strong>, a heavy, evolving <strong>sub-bassline</strong>, and hypnotic, <strong>slightly metallic synth textures</strong>. It lands somewhere between hard techno and futuristic electronica, expertly maintaining a dance-floor focus while showcasing an intricate, almost industrial sound design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;hit me where it hurts x&#8217; is out now on all major streaming platforms.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/skrillex-links-up-with-dylan-brady-caroline-polachek-for-hit-me-where-it-hurts-x/\">Skrillex Links Up With Dylan Brady &amp; Caroline Polachek For ‘hit me where it hurts x’</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

It&nbsp;found that the French duo, Maud Geﬀray and Sébastien Chenut, brings all-new poetic flair, cinematic atmospheres, and a dreamy, melancholic mix of synth, techno, and cold wave sounds. It is the latest standout project in a career spanning over 20 years, with millions of streams, high-profile syncs, and headline sets all over the world. Their next album arrives in September 2026, but first comes this single with Zamilska, who counts Nine Inch Nails and Iggy Pop as big fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Resurrection\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3Mb8qHjMgY2yoEaMkUdX8v?si=myMRF2FrS8GC2OIDzD-Bpw&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8216;Resurrection&#8217; is a powerful track with a slow, raw and heavy techno mood built through robotic rhythms, with ravey synths adding colour.

Instead of leaning on big moments, it leans into space, clarity, and small movements that slowly shift the mood forward. It feels intentional without feeling rigid, shaped by trust in the process rather than the need to fill every moment. Where some tracks reach for impact, this one lets tension sit just under the surface, making each new layer feel earned.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Track’s Feel and Approach</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"591\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-07-at-12.15.03-PM-1024x591.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82121\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-07-at-12.15.03-PM-1024x591.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-07-at-12.15.03-PM-300x173.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-07-at-12.15.03-PM-768x443.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-07-at-12.15.03-PM-1536x886.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-07-at-12.15.03-PM.jpg 1576w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From the opening elements, <em>carrier</em> sets its pace and stays honest to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The percussion stays grounded, the textures drift in quietly, and nothing arrives before it needs to. mono sky has a way of letting elements breathe without feeling empty, a balance that comes from experience and restraint. It feels like the work of someone who knows when to hold back and when to step forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mix leaves room for each part to exist without fighting for attention. Low-end elements sit underneath like a foundation rather than a focus. Melodic fragments float in and out, never overstated, and the shifts in motion come from subtle changes rather than obvious drops or breaks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It speaks to the artist’s growth, especially in how they now value simplicity and intention in their work.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Process, Persistence, and Letting Go</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/mono-sky-reflects-on-process-and-presents-the-early-premiere-of-carrier/\" target=\"_blank\">In our interview around the premiere</a>, mono sky talked about the difficulty of knowing when a track is finished and the instinct to keep making small changes that do not always make a track better. That mindset is a big part of <em>carrier</em>. There is a sense of completion in the track, but also traces of that internal conversation between letting go and improving. It makes the release feel honest rather than overly polished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also spoke about how persistence shapes any artist’s path. The first versions of a sound rarely define someone. It comes from showing up, finishing ideas, and allowing growth to take time. That mindset is clear here. <em>carrier</em> does not try to solve everything in one track. It adds another piece to the larger story of an artist figuring things out in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.beatport.com/release/carrier/5476266\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>carrier</em> by mono sky is available now on all streaming platforms via Magnetic Magazine Recordings.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/mono-sky-releases-carrier-on-magnetic-magazine-recordings/\">mono sky Releases ‘carrier’ on Magnetic Magazine Recordings</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

I started the album before Serum 2 came out so a lot of the sounds were made in Serum 1, but towards the end of the process I was going deep on Serum 2 and having a lot of fun with it. It’s definitely my go to synth at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people are familiar with Serum. It’s probably the most popular soft synth on the market, and for good reason. I mostly use it for basses, but it’s great for leads, pads, keys… You name it. The updates they’ve added to Serum 2 are fantastic. Having that extra oscillator has allowed me to create sounds within one patch that would have previously required multiple layers on different tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also love that you can now double up effects in the FX panel, for example having multiple distortions or filters in a row. I’ve always been more of a post-processing guy so being able to do all that within the patch has been super fun. Look out for a Serum 2 preset pack from me very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s kinda hard to generalise my process in Serum for this track as there are SO many bass sounds in this project… It’s kinda crazy. I was going for a maximalist brostep vibe with this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I never use presets in Serum (unless they’re my own) so every sound was made from scratch. My sound design process involves a lot of experimentation, but I’d call it “informed experimentation” as I have a lot of go to sound design methods and tricks that I employ, but I kind of mess around until I get something I like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use FM quite a lot (I guess it’s PD in Serum 2) as I find it much easier to create a unique sound that way. I’m also a huge fan of the Glork Tables (third party wavetables made by Glorkglunk, pick them up on his Gumroad) and I use them a tonne in all my projects. And I’m a sucker for simple analog wavetables like saw waves and square waves which I’ll use as a solid foundation for a sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of processing bass I usually end up using multiple distortions, OTT, compression, EQ, clipping and some kind of imager (most often Ozone Imager). It totally depends on the sound though. I’m not a big reverb guy, I usually like my sounds fairly dry, but I will throw a short reverb in the chain sometimes to give the sound some air. Automating the wet signal can be fun for some extra movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I did a lot on this track was completely remaking a sound from scratch if I got stuck. I often find that if a sound is not working, starting from an initial patch and simplifying the patch and effects chain works wonders. Keeping things simple is key. If something is too layered and processed it can be very hard to make it sound solid and cohesive.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>StandardClip</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-StandardClip-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82367\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-StandardClip-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-StandardClip-300x187.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-StandardClip-768x480.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-StandardClip-1536x959.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/3-StandardClip.jpg 1934w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m obsessed with StandardClip. It has such a great sound. Since I started using StandardClip my mixes have improved tenfold. Clippers essentially shave off the loudest peaks of a sound, so they’re great for getting more loudness out of your mix. I also love the sound you get from pushing hard into a clipper. It crunches stuff up really nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StandardClip is all over this track. I’m predominantly using it on the drums and basses, and I’m always using it on my master chain (sometimes it’s the only thing on there).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of drums I love to use StandardClip after a transient shaper and compressor (Glue Compressor is my go to). That way I can amp up the transients then shave off the peaks so I have a super snappy kick or snare without any spiky peaks. Snares sound awesome being driven super hard into a clipper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With basses I usually have StandardClip right at the end of the chain acting almost like a limiter to get them sounding super loud and to squash any dynamics out of them. Growly mid range basses always sound great being smashed into the clipper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you have to be careful with when using a clipper is distorting the low end. With basses I always have a separate sub these days so I can get away with clipping the mid range part of the bass without affecting the sub. With kicks I’ll sometimes use Pro-MB to compress the low end of the kick before going into StandardClip to prevent distortion.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Oszillos Mega Scope</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-Oszillos-Mega-Scope-2-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82368\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-Oszillos-Mega-Scope-2-1024x640.png 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-Oszillos-Mega-Scope-2-300x188.png 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-Oszillos-Mega-Scope-2-768x480.png 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-Oszillos-Mega-Scope-2-1536x960.png 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/4-Oszillos-Mega-Scope-2-2048x1280.png 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oszillos Mega Scope is my go to visualiser. It looks a lot like the waveform on Rekordbox or Serato which is something I’ve been looking at for a long time, so I know what a good mix looks like. It’s a handy way to see both the frequency content and the waveform of a track at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m mostly using Oszillos Mega Scope to make sure things are loud enough, specifically the kick, the snare, the sub and also the track as a whole. Sometimes it might sound like the kick or snare is hitting where it should be when actually you need to boost it a few db.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think to get the most out of a plugin like this it’s helpful to analyse other peoples music to see what a solid mix looks like and go from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trick I use for mixing is putting a low pass filter before Oszillos Mega Scope so I can see what the relationship between the kick and the sub is. Maybe the kick is too quiet compared to the sub or vice versa. Or maybe the sidechain is too short or too long. Paying close attention to those kinds of details can make a huge difference in your mix.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ozone Imager</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.47.45-PM-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82369\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.47.45-PM-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.47.45-PM-300x187.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.47.45-PM-768x480.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.47.45-PM-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.47.45-PM.jpg 1740w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozone Imager is a multiband imager that allows you to adjust or add width to different frequency bands. For example you could make the low end of a sound completely mono and have the width gradually increase as you get further up the frequency spectrum. I mostly use it on basses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a long time my basses were mostly mono but towards the end of the album mixing process I had a session with Woofax and he pointed out that I could get away with a lot more width on my basses. I’ve been obsessed with Ozone Imager ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally my settings in Ozone Imager is a 4 band split with everything below 120hz mono and each band after that getting gradually wider. I usually use the stereoize function to add extra width with between 6 and 13 milliseconds of delay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have an Ableton rack I’ve made that allows me to do multiband imaging using the free plugin Wider. This is super effective too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A trick I’ve been doing a lot lately is layering a fairly mono mid range bass with a super wide low mid layer like a deeper FM bass or a wavetable like Harmonic Series or FFT Add 2nds in Serum. This keeps the main grit of the sound clean while still making it sound huge in the stereo field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quickfire Tips For Making Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"860\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.48.39-PM-1024x860.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82371\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.48.39-PM-1024x860.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.48.39-PM-300x252.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.48.39-PM-768x645.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-at-3.48.39-PM.jpg 1146w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Screenshot</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tip 1</strong><br>HAVE FUN.

Her voice doesn’t reach for effect; it&nbsp;simply lands&nbsp;there, with all its warmth and gravity. This new song expands the edges of Sasha&#8217;s sound until something new and undeniable emerges.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: To Stay\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/0jNJZVXvyNTJkuBr1y5B7P?si=OMftkLpHRvmtgejRJ4au-A&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sasha Joy writes songs that live between movement and stillness. The groove is there, featuring supple basslines, jazz flourishes, and crisp production, but it’s the emotional core in her voice that carries her. She sings like someone who’s done the work, who understands that simplicity can hit hardest when everything around it is true. Each lyric feels hand-cut, not polished to perfection but refined through honesty &#8211; making her music truly feel real.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press_Image_2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82209\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press_Image_2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press_Image_2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press_Image_2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press_Image_2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Press_Image_2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Her lineage of influence runs deep: Lauryn Hill’s soul-searching, Amy Winehouse’s smoky candor, the pulsing funk and the Balkan folk ballads of her childhood turning into universal language. That blend gives her music its texture, that flicker of recognition before it turns the corner into something surprising. Simply put, it&#8217;s what separates her from everyone else, and that unique quality is on full display in &#8220;To Stay&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a time when playlists overflow with algorithmic sameness, Sasha Joy is building something quieter and more enduring, writing music that speaks from the inside out. “To Stay” feels like a statement and a promise: a declaration of presence, a mark in the soil. She isn’t asking for space in the conversation, as she’s already carved her own. Quite simply, she&#8217;s here to stay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stream &#8220;To Stay&#8221; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0jNJZVXvyNTJkuBr1y5B7P?si=OMftkLpHRvmtgejRJ4au-A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/sasha-joy-pushes-her-sound-forward-with-standout-new-single-to-stay/\">Sasha Joy Pushes Her Sound Forward with Standout New Single &#8220;To Stay&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

      "fullContent": "<p>On Saturday, March 28, in Downtown Los Angeles, Insomniac will hold its 5th annual Entertainer Audition at Exchange. As a tryout for the bold who hope to one day stoke the audience from onstage, within the crowd, and all throughout the festival footprint, the audition is one of the most memorable dance culture experiences of our time. To some performers, it’s a reunion for the family they’ve created together. To others, it’s a chance to chase their dreams of glory on an Insomniac stage. Ultimately, the audition experience is one of our most asked-about and inspiring events throughout the year, because it offers a deeper glimpse into a life of professional performance for any soul brave enough to contemplate a career onstage.</p>\n<p>If you’re one of the many thinking about auditioning, but you’re on the fence—wondering “What’s the experience of it actually like?” or “How do I know it’s for me?”—then we’ve got just the spotlight to put on the situation!</p>\n<p>To learn all this and more, we sat down with the casting queen behind the scenes, MsEasy. From her vantage point as Entertainment Director, Easy oversees everything that has anything to do with entertainers at Insomniac events. From costumes to styling to management and more, she’s at the start, the finish, and every step in between. So, we rounded up the Qs she gets the most. Read on, and see what she had to say!</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/08221700/edclv_2020_misc_is_performer_audition_flyer_1080x1350_r08v01.png\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What’s it like to be in the family of Insomniac performers?<br />\n</strong>Inspiring. I think it’s a community that really bonds over their mutual interest in performing and sharing their performance with Headliners or with the crowd in general, wherever they may be. In the Insomniac performer family, we get to travel together, and I see a lot of the relationships turn into lifelong friendships. You see that the bond is really strong. It’s not just a job; it’s a lifestyle. It’s an actual community that I think really is open. We like to receive people. It seems like it’s really life-changing when people come fully into the circle.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the process from application to the stage?<br />\n</strong>The true audition starts at 1pm, but around noon (or even earlier), people will start lining up to fill out performer applications. We ask that everyone bring portfolio pictures, like headshots, so they can be easily found later throughout the process. People ask if it’s necessary, but I think it makes you look professional, legitimate, and serious about your craft. The headshots don’t have to be on a professional level; it’s just something that represents you that you’ve put a little effort into.</p>\n<p>They’re gonna drop off all their information, fill out their application, and they’ll get a number. They’ll be sent into the photographer room, where they’ll have their picture taken. Then they will go from there to the queue line for the actual audition. We’ll see 2–3 people at a time, and they’ll have the ability to go from one platform to the next, so it spans minutes—sometimes less. That’s the <strong><em>freestyle round</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>People I want to see go into a second round, the <strong><em>choreography round</em></strong>, get a callback slip. I don’t need to see every kind of performer or every single dancer for the choreography round, and not everyone gets called back for it. Some people think that when they don’t get a callback for the choreography round that they’re out, which isn’t the case. There’s just another <strong><em>technical round</em></strong> that some people will get put into, and others won’t. Not make or break, but this is a part of it.</p>\n<p>Some people will get callback slips. They will go into a choreography room, where choreographers will be teaching them their own sequence of dance, so nobody has to come with choreography, rehearsed material, or music. There will be a live DJ playing the entire time. More or less, you just show up as you, and you get put into different rounds.</p>\n<p>They learn the choreography, and the teams will come back up in groups of 6–8 and perform. This round is also specific to, but not just pertaining to, kineticFIELD casting. Casting for kineticFIELD at EDC Las Vegas, the stage that travels the world, will be selected from this round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204431/BYDSOCAL2018_0317_175008-9670_JSL.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>If I’m already an Insomniac entertainer, do I have to show up and audition?<br />\n</strong>My answer is always YES. One, it’s good for us to be able to reassess people’s skills every single year. It’s like an update. I would like to be able to see if people improved. It’s a great time to showcase your talent and be seen for reevaluation every year. This also for me is a time where I really see people showing up for their team and their craft; it’s kinda like that quote: “80% of success is showing up.” I really believe that you show up for what you want, and the people that show up are the ones who get the casting. All of the positions for EDC Las Vegas itself will book from this audition.</p>\n<p>I would also like to see a lot of different types of entertainers in the freestyle round. First of all, it is dance-based, but more that anything, I’m looking for stage presence. If you’re not particularly a dancer—or let’s say you want to be a mascot, or you’re an aerialist, or you’re any other kind of entertainer—I will see your stage presence when you audition. You don’t necessarily have to be a technical dancer, but show me the charisma or the ability or the energy or whatever it is you’re trying to put forth. You can always specify on your resume or your application what you focus on or what you’re applying for.</p>\n<p><strong>If I’m an aerialist, should I audition through the dance round?<br />\n</strong>We don’t have a rig to audition aerial at the venue, so I’m encouraging aerialist to still show up and be seen in person, because it’s the easiest way to get your foot in the door if you put yourself in front of a judge or casting director. Me seeing you in person gives me more of an idea of your ability and your energy and your presence. I like to see their faces in person. There is a <strong><em>specialty round</em></strong> for stilters, acrobats, and contortionists. A lot of these specialty acts we’ll do in a round after the freestyle round but before the choreography round.</p>\n<p><strong>I’m a stilter. Should I bring my stilts?<br />\n</strong>Yes. Go through the first round, and then stilt-up for the specialty round.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204500/NW2018_0914_224736-5112_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>Are you auditioning all types of performers?<br />\n</strong>At the end of the day, all types of entertainers can audition. If they specify on their application, I will see that they aren’t necessarily applying for a dance role, but we don’t have any special equipment, like aerial rigs. We don’t allow flow props in the venue, so that means hoops or fire arts. Anything large that is spinning or handheld won’t be allowed. Those people can still apply by email application at <a href=\"mailto:mseasy@insomniac.com\">mseasy@insomniac.com</a>. However, I would like for hoopers to still audition through the dance line. That way, I can still see them. I have a lot of performers who do specialty hoop but end up doing other roles for us at the event. I like our entertainers to be multitalented and flexible, so they have the ability to fill more than one role. It never hurts if you’re an amazing hooper to come try out, because I may have something for you later.</p>\n<p><strong>What are newcomers most surprised by at the auditions?<br />\n</strong>I think they’re excited, because Insomniac events are so dynamic and magical. We have people fly in from all over the country. To be with hundreds of people and to feel that energy and excitement—this is one reason why I want to push people to audition, because it’s a great experience. One, it helps you assess where you’re at as an entertainer, and two, it will reaffirm your goals and desires as an entertainer. I have a lot of people come up to me afterward to say what an inspiring day it was for them. “This is pushing me to be a better entertainer, and I now realize where I need to improve.” There are a lot of benefits to auditioning.</p>\n<p>Sometimes people are surprised to see that much talent and diversity and how many people there are all with the same hopes, wishes, and goals. In fact, a lot of entertainers say it’s one of the bigger auditions they’ve ever attended. Even though we’re a music festival company, we view entertainment as a key part of the experience.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204528/NW2018_0915_012903-6000_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p><strong>What do I wear to an audition?<br />\n</strong>In the dance community, it’s common practice to wear fitted clothing. On the flyer, it does say low-rise dance shorts and crop tops for females. Heels, wedges or boots, hair and makeup, fitted clothing for men and women. If you’re really covering yourself up and I can’t see your silhouette or the way you move, it could hinder the outcome of your audition. Come in what is considered professional attire. Keep it simple; you don’t want to distract from your talent with your outfit. The only time that doesn’t apply is when your outfit is really part of your talent, and the only time that comes into play is when you’re a drag queen or some type of specialty performer that relies heavily on their outfit. So, you need to kind of assess what you want to be cast as and how that pertains to how you look.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s the easiest way for an audition to go wrong?<br />\n</strong>The number one thing I see that goes wrong is that people lose their confidence. I know it can be a lot of pressure leading up to the moment, but you have to believe in yourself and be comfortable while you’re auditioning, because it really shows. People really speed up, but I think in my mind, “Just slow it down; it’s going to be okay.” Another huge one is that people look down. I want to see what you have to offer to the crowd. I want you to connect. I want to feel what it is you’re trying to convey to our audience, and I’m your audience in that moment. If you’re looking down at the ground the entire time, you’re not smiling, or you’re going too fast, then you’re losing your chance.</p>\n<p>This is a very positive place with an amazing community of people. You’ll see pros helping novice dancers. I love walking around and feeling that kind of energy and community that’s happening between strangers. Like, the old schoolers watching the new people come in and helping them and giving them pointers and working on choreo with them. It sounds cheesy, but it’s heartwarming because it reinforces the love I have for what we do. That’s one of things that makes Insomniac so different. It’s that vibe; it’s the heart that’s in it. Out of all the large-scale auditions out there, I feel that this is the most welcoming and least scary one.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s a piece of advice you’d pass on to someone asking about auditioning for the first time?<br />\n</strong>Try and try again. It’s the performer’s mantra. Also, if you’re gonna talk the talk, make sure you walk the walk. Back up what you want with skill. Go take classes and be serious about what you want to do, because it’ll show.</p>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/29204607/NW2018_0916_010937-9895_SSH.jpg\" alt=\"What to Expect at the Insomniac Performer Auditions\"/></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>The Performer Auditions take place at 1pm on Saturday, March 28, at Exchange LA, located at 618 S.

Such is the case with us having found out about <strong>Truthlive</strong>, a special producer from San Francisco, who&#8217;s got to the ears of many, and the worldwide charts lately too. And the best part of it all is, he&#8217;s got no one style to stick to: <strong>he masters many trades</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With<strong> two Beatport #1 chartings</strong> this year alone, he&#8217;s going all-in this time around. Having released a dancefloor-heavy belter, &#8216;<strong>Going Up</strong>&#8216;, not too long ago, and just having released an impressive Melodic House record, &#8216;<strong>Surrender</strong>&#8216;, we kindly invite you to take a look at just how good a sound this guy has. He doesn&#8217;t miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just off the heels of two monumental releases, and the potential Evan has of absolutely blowing up sometime soon, this was the best time to get an interview with him. We discussed it all, from his styles of music, to his philosophy on the industry, and everything in between. Without further to do, sit back and read on, as we dive deep, quite deep, into conversation with Truthlive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-interview\">The Interview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(Please note, the&nbsp;<strong>bolded</strong>&nbsp;text represents a question, while the paragraph(s) following it represent Truthlive’s answers.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Congratulations on the release of ‘Going Up’! We’d love to know, how did the track come to be? What’s the story behind it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. The song has overlapping origin stories. I had two basic ideas floating around in my head for a while. One is to make a song that captures the sound and feeling of what it&#8217;s like to enter a warehouse party, underground, or rave. There is this shared experience people don&#8217;t talk about much that is a really special part of the culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignright is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Going Up\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2FSfukWKbmqkrgHT6zFCLM?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole anticipation of what is next as you first walk up and can only make out in the distance the rumble of the bass, the pounding of the tempo. You hear it, you feel it. The closer you get the louder it gets, the clearer it gets, until you finally make it all the way inside and can actually make out and hear all the different frequencies and are with all the people. It&#8217;s this beautiful communal birth and rebirth each time. My mood always changes going through that process. I cherish it, and I tried to capture it in the arch of the arrangement. And the other concept hit me every single time I have used an elevator for like the last 10 years. You know that generic elevator voice? &#8220;Going up. Going down. 5th floor.&#8221; All of that. I have always been like, I need to sample that! So I did. It&#8217;s literally an elevator sample.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original track titles I wanted to use were San Francisco Elevator Music or Warehouse Elevator Music, but that seemed sorta clunky, so I went with simply Going Up. The notion of going up and going down is then applicable to so many things, from the experience at raves to just whatever in life in general. I noticed the song is being added to lots of gym and workout playlists, which isn&#8217;t what I intended, but makes sense. It&#8217;s dope when music can apply differently to different people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now, about your fresly released track ‘Surrender’, out today, that’s quite a leap from the hard, dancefloor-oriented energy of ‘Going Up’. What’s the story behind that one?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, they are way different, for sure, but both are still very much me as a person and artist. My creative process is motivated more by feeling than genre. Sometimes I have a certain vibe already in mind, but overall I try not to fight or force inspiration. I do think it&#8217;s a smart craft discipline to continue to work even when you aren&#8217;t inspired, but overall allowing what you feel to come through, rather than what you think you should be making because of what other people expect of you, is what leads me to my best results. It&#8217;s also what helps keep me inspired and interested. Experimenting and exploring. Sometimes I go hard, like Going Up. Sometimes I am at a beautiful rooftop vibing, like Surrender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Going Up is very much not chill. It goes hard. It bangs. It is high energy. But both songs do what I want my music to do—make people genuinely feel something.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed alignleft is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Surrender\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4Tk79HSxKGt40op25acN0x?utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Surrender is definitely a more musical kind of electronic music and almost sounds like an actual band even though I composed it with synthesizers and drum machines, sorta in the vein of Kaytranada—if I dare mention the God in the same breath as me. I would call it Soulful Deep House or maybe even straight-up R&amp;B? I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t really care. I like it. I feel it. It sounds good. It feels good. I am proud of it. It&#8217;s smooth, beautiful, and dreamy. As a DJ, I am definitely playing it poolside, or in sexy lounges, or maybe even in warm-up club sets. It is still 120 BPM even with all that Dilla-inspired slump in the groove.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erica Ambrin, the vocalist, is a very dynamic and super talented artist. She sings, raps, plays instruments, all at a high level. She blessed the vocals on Surrender big time. I can&#8217;t thank her enough. The rough draft was in the can for a while. I think she thought I wasn&#8217;t gonna finish it or put it out. I appreciate her patience. Also, my dude Kerry Conlan from Parson Jones, another musical mega talent, added some live instrumentation that took the track to a more magical place with some really pretty guitar and xylophone runs. The final session engineer, Jake from Xotix, known for his own really dope-ass bass music production, really took the track to the finish line with the mixing and mastering work. It sounds polished yet organic at the same time. That&#8217;s sonically a hard balance to achieve. Dude is the shit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had the beat done for a while, and my demo sounded pretty close to the way it does now, but having the honor to work with such gifted collaborators made it so much better and complete feeling. It was a team effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How does an artist’s mind work to create music in different styles? We’re so used to a name representing just one style of music that we’d love to dive into it. Do you come to the studio with different moods, for example?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. I am a human, right? People are many things. I am many things. I go through mood shifts like anyone else does, and it definitely influences my musical direction. I am not knocking what anyone else does or what works for them, but I am a dynamic person who loves a wide variety of music, who has successfully DJ&#8217;d and created a wide variety of music. I&#8217;ve earnestly invested a lot of time in different communities—locally, regionally, nationally, globally—both personally and professionally. It&#8217;s only right that all of that is represented in my process and songs. Who knows? Maybe people will respond more or less to certain sounds, and I will let the audience guide me to some degree, as that is part of compromising for economic survival. But whatever I do, I gotta feel it. What I feel is probably going to change and evolve. That is being human. That is art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you ever considered using different aliases to create different styles of music, or does it make more sense to you to have your Truthlive name on your entire catalogue?</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"alignright size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-scaled.jpeg\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-768x1024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392820\" style=\"width:374px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-696x928.jpeg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-1068x1424.jpeg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-scaled.jpeg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-1-12-315x420.jpeg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This has been an ongoing war in my mind. I do have other aliases. A few of them. I just haven&#8217;t shared them. I have almost fully rebranded or tried alias-based projects a few times to keep the same styles more cohesive. But a name is whatever you make it. And I am all of these things. It might be a smarter marketing approach to stick to a more narrow expectation, but what&#8217;s authentic to me is to do all of these things under one banner. At least for now. If I can garner more attention, maybe I can make that move for future projects. In short, fuck genres. I just want to make music that I feel, that hopefully makes others feel too. Not all of it is for everyone else. And frankly, it&#8217;s a little boring, in my opinion, to make the same shit over and over and over again. I believe listeners are also as dynamic in their tastes, and lots of people will appreciate the range. Dope music is dope music. Maybe people will find it more interesting that the same artist does different things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After having great releases which top the Beatport charts, does that ever feel like an added weight on your shoulders? Like extra pressure to make music “as good as those songs”?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, shoutout Mise en Place Records and my dude Mykill, who put out both EPs that hit #1. They are also releasing Surrender. They&#8217;ve been really supportive of me artistically. That success has been cool, but also modest. It was certainly unexpected to hit #1. I think it was a little bit of my social media presence and mostly my DJ career that drove it. Lots of people are familiar with me as a DJ but maybe hadn&#8217;t heard my original music. Those releases were as grassroots as possible. No budget. Literally $0. I am still hella grassroots with it now. The response is real and organic, granted it&#8217;s time to put fuel in the tank. I wouldn&#8217;t say that I feel pressure to make music as good as those songs as much as I feel motivated to focus, hone in, fine-tune, improve, and expand. It&#8217;s time to apply more intention and better practices. It&#8217;s like, okay, I have some momentum, some people are paying attention, let&#8217;s harness that. Honestly, those prior releases don&#8217;t even sound like fully finished songs to me. I have an unorthodox production process. I usually don&#8217;t let myself spend more than a few hours on a track in total. I think it should all flow and come together pretty quickly, or don&#8217;t do it, move on. The tracks from the EPs technically aren&#8217;t even mixed or mastered in a way I&#8217;d call commercially ready. I do like them. They sound good enough sonically, but it was more of a mental exercise to just get stuff out, build foundation, get going. The main thing is output. Keep outputting. And keep getting better while outputting. I am in that mode now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s one unexpected thing that music has brought you and you’re thankful for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is an excellent question. I am a person who has been fortunate enough to have such a blessed life where I genuinely feel a sense of gratitude, always. I don&#8217;t need to conjure it or be offered a sense of perspective to see it. It&#8217;s there. But that feeling definitely gets expanded through musical experiences. I have learned to appreciate different kinds of music, different scenes and sub-scenes I haven&#8217;t always been initially drawn to. I am thankful for how that has made me understand and appreciate different people, places, and communities, and myself, in a more connected way.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-scaled.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"658\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-1024x658.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392821\" style=\"width:626px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-1024x658.jpg 1024w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-300x193.jpg 300w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-768x493.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-1536x987.jpg 1536w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-2048x1315.jpg 2048w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-696x447.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-1068x686.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-1920x1233.jpg 1920w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TRUTHLiVE_Day-2-16-654x420.jpg 654w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could travel to the past any number of years you might find interesting, and meet your past self of that era, what would you tell him? Was there something you were far too worried about for instance?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Damn. I don&#8217;t typically relate to my life that way, as everything I have ever done has led me to right here, right now, even the mistakes. I am good with that. But I guess I would tell my past self to always have the curiosity and humility to listen to the wisdom of others to help inform and shape your understanding, but ultimately trust yourself. Follow what feels creatively right to you. Considering the industry rules has some value, but trying to squeeze yourself into a box defined by others’ interpretations probably won&#8217;t make you happy or fulfilled, even if it works commercially. Do you. Do what you love. Share more of that. It&#8217;s okay if it&#8217;s not perfect. Find your people and your audience that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-final-words\">Final Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the kind of interview I love, and that I&#8217;m so grateful I can sort of be &#8220;the vehicle&#8221; for such output. Evan is quite the interesting person to talk to, and you can see in the depth of his answers, that his artistry doesn&#8217;t really answer for a call for anything other than pure, unfiltered passion. I love it when artists, well, make art. As obvious as it may seem, in today&#8217;s world, we don&#8217;t always have that for granted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks so much Truthlive for this feature, and the valuable (<em>priceless</em>) reflections and deep dives. Once again, this is my idea of an ideal interview: true honesty, and hearing words that come from a place of, not vulnerability, but behind the usual rockstar-ey mask one tends to associate artists with. We&#8217;re human too, at least, at the time this post has gone live.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/2025/11/interview-truthlive/\">[INTERVIEW] Truthlive Talks Latest Release &#8216;Surrender&#8217;, Breaking Patterns, Fulfilment, And More</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com\">EDMTunes</a>.</p>\n",

The festival returns <strong>December 5-6 </strong>at its brand-new home, the <strong>RC Cola Plant + Green Space</strong> at <strong>Mana Wynwood</strong>, bringing a reworked format that fuses large-scale art, wellness, and global dance music under one roof.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking place during <strong>Art Basel Miami Beach</strong> and <strong>Miami Art Week</strong>, Art With Me has expanded its creative partners to include <a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/zamna/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"24361\"><strong>Zamna</strong> </a>and <strong><a href=\"https://edmidentity.com/tag/disco-presents/\" data-type=\"post_tag\" data-id=\"24993\">Disco Presents</a></strong>, and the lineup reflects that broader creative vision. Beyond the music, the Wynwood venue will also transform into a walkable playground built around the festival&#8217;s six pillars: art, dance, breathe, play, care, and eat. Attendees can expect large-scale installations, wellness sessions, family-friendly offerings, and curated culinary moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the festival&#8217;s return isn&#8217;t just about the names on the flyer; it&#8217;s about intent. Co-founder Matt Caines says this year marks a new chapter that leans deeper into art, integrity, and emotional resonance. Newly announced additions <strong>CamelPhat</strong> and <strong>Sofi Tukker</strong> bring major heavyweight power, one delivering festival-sized melodic techno, the other known for their vibrant, high-energy live shows. They join an array of selectors and hybrid performers who push emotional depth and impact on the dancefloor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the full musical experience ticket-holders can expect? On Friday, folks can immersive themselves with a headlining set by <strong>Eric Prydz</strong>, the energy of <strong>CamelPhat</strong>, <strong>Luciano</strong>, <strong>Dixon b2b Jimi Jules</strong>, <strong>Neil Frances presents: Club NF</strong>, and a live set from <strong>Parra for Cuva</strong>. To top off the day, <strong>Amog</strong>, <strong>Ella Romand</strong>, <strong>Luca Saporito</strong>, <strong>Matt Caines</strong>, and <strong>Santiago Garcia</strong> will also grace the festival grounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, party-goers can expect sets from <strong>LP Giobbi</strong>, <strong>Lee Burridge</strong>, <strong>Christian Löffler</strong>, and <strong>WhoMadeWho,</strong> with additional sets from <strong>Anthony Middleton</strong>, <strong>Enamour</strong>, <strong>Facundo Mohrr</strong>, <strong>Lauren</strong> <strong>Ritter</strong>, <strong>Patrik</strong> <strong>Khach</strong>, <strong>Pippi Ciez</strong>, and <strong>Tim Green</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Art With Me has always been about something bigger than a party — we curate, with intention, a balanced and elevated experience made to inspire through art and creativity,&#8221; shared Caines. &#8220;What we’re creating at Mana Wynwood isn’t just another event — it’s the next evolution of what Art With Me stands for.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With its strongest lineup to date and a renewed sense of purpose, Art With Me&#8217;s 2025 edition looks ready to reassert itself as one of the most distinctive events of the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Single-day and weekend tickets are on sale now on the Art With Me </strong><a href=\"http://artwithmemiami.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>website</strong></a><strong>, and make sure to follow them on socials to stay up-to-date on additional art and wellness programming.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Zamna Presents Art With Me 2025 &#8211; Lineup:</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1-819x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Art With Me 2025 Lineup\" class=\"wp-image-271160\" srcset=\"https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1-400x500.jpg 400w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1-768x960.jpg 768w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1-750x938.jpg 750w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://edmidentity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DDP-ART-BD-1080x1350-1.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-css-opacity is-style-default\"/>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Follow Art With Me:</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://artwithme.org/?fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnTnWq4IEN-1LhFdhwUM3QsafbKDDZVN2ZNW_ZcoIph_pr1INjclEWn2aHNog_aem_jk8OZlF4Nn_AjjmakfedkQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/artwithmefestival/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/artwithmelife/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com/2025/11/14/art-with-me-2025-lineup/\">Art With Me Returns to Miami with its Most Ambitious Lineup Yet</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://edmidentity.com\">EDM Identity</a>.</p>\n",

It&#8217;s not uncommon for artists to do this sort of rebrand when they&#8217;re about to do something exciting or introduce a huge new chapter in his career, but for Tiësto to do it, it must mean something quite colossal is underway. <strong>And we think it&#8217;s got to do with Trance</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-a-he-s-changing-his-style-again\">Option A: He&#8217;s changing his style (again)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know for a fact Tiësto is a man of many genres, dominating the Trance space towards the early 2000s and moving to slower music afterwards, opening up to Mainstage music (the mighty Electro House back in 2013), and many, many different sounds, even going Progressive and Melo Techno under his Lockdown alias VER:WEST. So who says he&#8217;s not doing that again?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-bonus-we-think-it-may-be-trance\">BONUS: We think it may be Trance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As of the time of writing, the countdown has six days and change to go. That means <strong>Dreamstate</strong>. Dreamstate is arguably the largest Trance festival to ever hit the US. And Tijs is widely <strong>promoted as playing a &#8220;Trance Set&#8221;</strong> while he&#8217;s over there. He also played many adapted classics (like, REAL classics like Salt Tank&#8217;s &#8216;Eugina&#8217;) at EDC Las Vegas earlier this year. Look, we may be exaggerating, but we&#8217;re putting the pieces together, and the puzzle just comes alive&#8230;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large is-resized\"><a href=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"824\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-824x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-392787\" style=\"width:482px;height:auto\" srcset=\"https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-824x1024.jpg 824w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-241x300.jpg 241w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-768x954.jpg 768w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-1236x1536.jpg 1236w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-696x865.jpg 696w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-1068x1327.jpg 1068w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n-338x420.jpg 338w, https://www.edmtunes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545170291_1213066334196218_6203959688134352162_n.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-b-he-s-releasing-an-album\">Option B: He&#8217;s releasing an album</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while since Tiësto released his last album <em><strong>DRIVE</strong></em> in 2023, so this may very well be a possibility. But it doesn&#8217;t really justify the social media wiping. It&#8217;s not bee, say, ten years since his last LP. And the logo change also feels like, if an album plays a part in this new chapter of Tiësto, it&#8217;s not the main course, but rather, an add-on. Which leads us to believe&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-option-c-it-s-both\">Option C: It&#8217;s both</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>And may God hear our prayers that this all points to a new Trance album from Tiësto. We&#8217;ve MISSED the days of &#8216;Silence&#8217;, &#8216;Suburban Train&#8217;, &#8216;Just Be&#8217; among many others, so it would be a true move to see him back in the Trance space. After all, he&#8217;s been at the top once; he can for sure do it twice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whatever the outcome is, marketing team did their job, &#8217;cause we&#8217;re hooked.

      "fullContent": "\n<p>Bass music thrives on reinvention, and <strong>GorillaT</strong> is proof. The producer and DJ has quickly risen by pushing boundaries with a wonky, unpredictable sound, high-voltage live performances, and a relentless release schedule. In just a few years, he’s dropped two albums, launched a headlining tour, and earned support from key figures in the scene—building a dedicated fanbase along the way. And now he&#8217;s cooked up a collaboration with live electronic duo <strong>Big Gigantic</strong> and soulful vocalist<strong> Born I</strong> that balances hip-hop introspection, live jazz instrumentation, and masterfully layered bass. If you&#8217;re craving a track that feels fresh, punchy, soulful, and adrenaline inducing, &#8216;<strong>Somewhere Up There&#8217;</strong> delivers it in spade.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Somewhere Up There\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0OuYYpukdjsSGuFlEqyuG8?si=b1b223f687b948e7&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The track opens with Born I’s voice—low, direct, almost spoken—over minimal percussion. Lyrics focus on shedding dead weight and turning damage into momentum. Big Gigantic’s production kicks in gradually. as their saxophone enters clean, no reverb, cutting through the mix with short, punchy phrases. GorillaT’s bass programming then enters as the track transitions to the drop &#8211; tight kicks, crisp snares, and sub drops that hit hard but stay controlled throughout. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow GorillaT on socials down below:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/gorillat/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The title track grounds this myth in ritualistic rhythm: pulsating, primal, and heavy with transcendental tension. Its twin,<strong> &#8216;Kore&#8217;</strong>, urges surrender through its hypnotic mantra: “<em>release yourself to the unknown</em>”. Both tracks evoke and inspire the transformation of the self. These kinds of dark and twisted sounds challenge listeners to experience different feelings, and release them through movements that go beyond words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ever-changing cycle of revival and death gleams through the tracks. Moreover, Psytrance, Hard techno, and Industrial textures collide in a synergetic battle. Electrifying synths twist around acid-driven percussion and organic harmonics, channeling both the mechanical and the mystical. The result is a soundscape that feels like a ceremony for machines that dream of meeting the gods. Lastly, GODTRIPPER seals the ritual with their very own Acid-heavy Kore remix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-more-of-jenna-shaw\">More of Jenna Shaw</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Austin-based Psywitch continues to conquer the underground, collecting our souls through intense BPMs and twisted mystical sounds.

In detail, Nico Moreno is famous for his intense energy, while Samuel Moriero represents a new generation that has learned from these techniques. &#8216;See Me Coming&#8217; captures this mix of power and control, combining rawness with structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-the-beginning-of-the-partnership-between-nico-moreno-and-samuel-moriero-that-led-to-the-release-of-see-me-coming\">The beginning of the partnership between Nico Moreno and Samuel Moriero that led to the release of &#8216;See Me Coming&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The collaboration began in early 2025 while both artists were touring. Moreno had recently headlined major festivals like <strong>Awakenings</strong> and <strong>EDC Orlando</strong>, while Moriero was building his reputation with club shows in Europe under his real name. Musically, the track shows their different styles: Moreno creates a raw, percussive beat, while Moriero adds precise details and balance. The result is clear and effective, featuring breathing distortion, strong basslines, and impactful drops. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Moreno, this single follows his album,<em><strong> You Can’t Stop The Movement</strong></em>, which reached over 1.6 million monthly listeners and expanded his influence. The new single acts as a reset, focusing on function and reinforcing the power of hard techno. Meanwhile, for Moriero, &#8216;See Me Coming&#8217; marks his entry into the scene. He has moved from viral success as DJSM to a deeper, more intricate production style. He represents a generation that pushes the limits of the genre while emphasizing emotional intensity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-a-new-period-in-the-genre-of-hard-techno\">A new period in the genre of hard techno</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, &#8216;See Me Coming&#8217; reflects the current state of hard techno in 2025. It is now a global language, present at festivals and warehouse events. The track shows how the genre has matured, balancing aggression with discipline and promoting collaboration.

The track delivers both with confidence, building anthemic melodies around genuine sentiment rather than settling for easy emotional manipulation. His &#8220;One Sound, Two Sides&#8221; philosophy translates into production that feels equally at home during peak-time festival moments and those rare club instances when everyone actually connects with the music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What separates this from typical progressive fare is TR3AL&#8217;s stated ambition beyond the booth. He&#8217;s developing a fully immersive live show incorporating visuals and motion-capture characters, treating each release as a narrative chapter rather than isolated singles. That cinematic storytelling approach is already evident in &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; &#8211; the track builds with genuine dramatic arc rather than just hitting familiar progressive house checkpoints.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a debut album and live show planned for 2026, TR3AL&#8217;s positioning himself as more than another festival circuit DJ. &#8220;Never Ending Love&#8221; captures what he describes as &#8220;the rush of energy you feel when you&#8217;re fully present&#8221; &#8211; ambitious conceptual framework aside, the track simply works as both emotional statement and dancefloor weapon.

One of the leading culprits: music — from personal listening habits to the volume of concerts and festivals. This feature explores the scope of what that epidemic is, how it impacts the music industry, and the steps we can take to protect our hearing while still enjoying the music we love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, several high-profile artists in the dance music community have brought attention to the growing issue of hearing damage. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/alesso\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Alesso</a> recently shed light on how his <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFnnDvgvKO1/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tinnitus diagnosis</a> led him to cancel a run of shows for the first time in his career. <a href=\"http://dancingastronaut.com/tag/dom-dolla\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dom Dolla</a> became a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1023512787754317&amp;id=340197166085886&amp;set=a.340204942751775\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">prominent advocate</a> for hearing protection after he was diagnosed with tinnitus in both ears back in 2017 —&nbsp;a condition that requires him to take extra precautions both in the studio and on stage. Earlier this year, Martin Garrix revealed on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvSk_D6IGj8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Figuring Out</em> podcast with Raj Shamani</a> that he, too, lives with tinnitus. He explained that he often keeps background music playing to mask the constant beeping in his ears, which he attributes to not wearing ear protection during long studio sessions and shows early in his career — a mistake he now regrets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These cases illustrate the harsh reality of tinnitus – a persistent ringing or beeping in the ears that never fully goes away. While symptoms vary from person to person, common side effects include difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, memory issues, heightened anxiety and stress, and even depression. In the most severe cases, tinnitus has been linked to suicidal thoughts due to its profound impact on mental health. It’s a stark reminder of just how serious this growing epidemic truly is.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industry499396311 18519966397000351 6249775361067574216 N 1 1 1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"484\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400845\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1-700x484.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/499396311_18519966397000351_6249775361067574216_n-1-1-1.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Martin Garrix recently shared that he deals with tinnitus.

Prolonged exposure to loud noise, including music, is one of the most common causes and can lead to both hearing loss and tinnitus. Most people describe it as a “ringing in the ears,” something many concertgoers have experienced after a show. While that post-concert ringing may seem harmless, it’s actually a sign of minor ear damage — and over time, repeated exposure can lead to permanent injury.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although hearing loss and tinnitus are technically different conditions, they often occur together. Both can develop after spending extended time in loud environments, and both are largely preventable with proper hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ear itself is a remarkable organ, but it has one major flaw: the tiny sensory cells responsible for hearing do not regenerate once they’re damaged. That means when it comes to hearing, prevention isn’t just important —&nbsp;it’s the only option.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig2 Ear Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"445\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig2-ear-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401614\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphics courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a direct link between hearing damage — especially untreated hearing loss — and an increased risk of developing dementia. Multiple large-scale studies have identified hearing loss as one of the most significant modifiable risk factors for dementia, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a science behind why this is a growing problem. Simply put, the human ear wasn&#8217;t designed for the loud environments we regularly encounter in the modern world. Before the Industrial Revolution, the planet was a quiet place, free from the constant hum of engines, machinery, and amplified sound. In just a few centuries — a blink in evolutionary time — the world has grown exponentially louder, and our ears haven’t had time to adapt. Among the biggest contributors to this problem is prolonged exposure to loud music. Yet, unlike our teeth or our eyes — where we visit dentists and optometrists for regular checkups — few people ever see an audiologist until it’s too late. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To better understand the epidemic and its implications for the music industry, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em> spoke with Dr. Shannon Switzer, a Chicago-based audiologist and Northwestern University graduate who is one of only about 15 audiologists in the U.S. specializing full-time in music industry audiology. A passionate dance music fan herself — having proudly attended her fifth ARC Music Festival this summer — Dr. Switzer brings a rare combination of clinical expertise and cultural insight to the conversation around hearing health.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryDom\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"524\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401611\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom-700x524.jpg 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dom.jpg 1236w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Dom Dolla holding up an earplug in a photo he posted to Facebook in 2017 detailing his tinnitus diagnosis.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>“Unlike industrial spaces — especially in the U.S. — there are no legal standards to regulate music as a potential source of sound injury,&#8221; Dr. Switzer says. &#8220;The only person looking out for you in these music spaces is you.&#8221; She&#8217;s right — while factories, warehouses, construction sites and other workplaces have OSHA laws that enforce hearing protection and give employees access to annual hearing tests, no such protections exist in the music industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because music is fun and positive, it doesn’t occur to us that it could be harmful to our health,” she explains. “What makes sound potentially dangerous comes down to both volume and exposure time — and dance music fans and artists are often logging longer and louder hours than anyone else.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Dr. Switzer, “If people don’t start changing their behaviors, down the line a large percentage of people are going to have some form of hearing loss, tinnitus or both.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why hearing protection – both the education and the application of it – is more crucial now than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this doesn’t mean people have to stop enjoying music. Far from it. There are effective ways to protect your ears without sacrificing the experience. While many factors can affect hearing health, volume is one of the few we can control — and managing it is key to preventing further damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Switzer serves as the Musicians Hearing Clinic Director at Sensaphonics, the company that pioneered high-fidelity earplugs. Sensaphonics specializes in custom-molded ear protection, and their technology inspired the universal models now popularized by brands like Eargasm and Loop. Their current clients include artists in the dance music scene like Porter Robinson, Gorgon City and Azzecca, plus other global touring acts like Lorde, Coldplay and Radiohead. They even work with NASA – underscoring the trust placed in them to deliver world-class hearing protection.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryFig3 Safe Decibal Levels Eng\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"508\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fig3-safe-decibal-levels-eng.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-401615\"/><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Graphic courtesy of the <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/noise-your-health/hearing-loss-tinnitus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Government of Canada</a> </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A common misconception with earplugs is that they diminish the live music experience. In reality, with the right earplug (not the cheap orange foam ones), they actually improve the overall audio quality. High-fidelity earplugs bring down the volume of the entire environment around you – including those pesky dance floor yappers and fan clackers – allowing the music to shine more clearly. The result is a cleaner, more balanced sound entering your ear, making for a richer and more enjoyable live experience. Even better, they don’t block out conversations with friends nearby — so you can still hear your buddy when they ask, “What’s this ID?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diehard dance music fan, Dr. Switzer understands if fans want to take their earplugs out every once in a while at shows. &#8220;If you can wear earplugs 85% of the time, I’m happy with that. It’s better to be consistent than perfect. If you want to take out your earplugs when your favorite song comes on, do it. Consistency is more important than having them in 100% of the time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not all doom and gloom when it comes to hearing health. The good news is that tinnitus and hearing loss from sound exposure is — for the most part — entirely preventable. And even for those already diagnosed, many are able to live full, healthy lives with proper care and awareness. Dr. Switzer says she’s “optimistic” about the future, noting that attitudes are shifting. “At first, no one thought about hearing health and music at all. Now, I’m seeing more and more people wearing earplugs at shows.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to that optimism is accessibility: high-quality earplugs designed specifically for live music environments are now better, more available, and more affordable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universal models like <a href=\"https://eargasm.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoqs_tEevWfQsANLE1GrzlXXPv-K-c6LGe2-jk3yYEKPlbjkL2HG\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Eargasm</a>, <a href=\"https://hears.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hears</a>, and <a href=\"https://us.loopearplugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Loop</a> are great entry points for casual concertgoers and offer strong protection. And for those looking to elevate both their hearing protection and their overall live music experience, custom-molded earplugs – made specifically to fit your ears – are the gold standard.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img alt=\"Wear earplugs: the rising epidemic of tinnitus and hearing loss in the music industryStats\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"520\" src=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-400849\" srcset=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats-700x520.png 700w, https://dancingastronaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/stats.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Source: World Health Organization, chart courtesy of Statista</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> had the opportunity to test a range of earplugs while researching this feature, and the custom-fitted models (courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/erseriesplugs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sensaphonics</a>) definitely stood out compared to the universal models. Because they’re molded specifically to the wearer’s ear, they’re far more comfortable for long-term use. Their high-fidelity filters deliver exceptional sound clarity, preserving every nuance of the music while reducing harmful volume levels. Most importantly, they offer superior protection by creating a complete seal – ensuring that all sound entering the ear is properly filtered through the hi-fi system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom earplugs are more expensive and require an extra step — getting an ear mold made by a local audiologist — but that shouldn’t deter dedicated live music fans. For anyone who regularly attends shows or festivals, they’re a worthwhile long-term investment in both safety and sound quality. And for those who can’t make the leap just yet, universal earplugs are still an excellent and affordable option — far better than going without protection. Sensaphonics even offers a <a href=\"https://www.sensaphonics.com/collections/earplugs/products/er-20-pro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">universal line</a> alongside their fitted designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is a list of quality, <em>Dancing Astronaut</em>-recommended earplug options on the market. From custom earplugs to cheap universal options and everything in between, there&#8217;s plenty of excellent options out there to fit any budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dancing Astronaut</em> implores the entire music community to look out for one another: encourage the use of earplugs, be an advocate for hearing health, and help spread awareness. We&#8217;ve only got one set of ears — protect them. Together, we can change the culture around hearing health for the better.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Earplugs

The Grimm leered at its loyal rave subjects all weekend from the main stage, occasionally reaching out a bony claw in an attempt to snatch up members of the audience. Atop the Grimm&#8217;s altar, names like Eric Prydz, The Chainsmokers, DJ Snake, Benny Benassi, and Zedd graced the stage throughout the weekend, giving us an affair to remember and proving that Halloween celebrations are back in full force!</p>\n<h2>Psycho Circus: We&#8217;re All Mad Here</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01194530/ESCAPE2021_1031_015603-4910_JMM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Psycho Circus, the madhouse where all lovers of bass could be found worshipping throughout the weekend, truly lived up to its name, bringing all the finest head-banging, face-melting vibrations we had to offer. Hosted by Bassrush on Day 1, disciples of the unholy Church of Bass gathered here to practice their dark, low-frequency rituals, accompanied by anthems from Noisia, Zomboy, Ganja White Night, Black Sun Empire, Lucii, and more. On Day 2, Audiotistic took over the stage, bringing us shriek-worthy sets from selects such as Jauz, Playboi Carti, Ekali, JSTJR, and Baauer.</p>\n<h2>Sewer District: Sounds from the Underground</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01231601/ESCAPE2021_1029_202521-9305_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Serving some of the nastiest house and techno all weekend long, Sewer District (hosted by Factory 93) gave the word &#8220;underground&#8221; a whole new meaning. The maze-like graffitied shipping container construction around the stage gave the sense of having just popped out of a manhole in the middle of downtown, ready to get dirty and demonic as the 4/4 beats wafted through the air. Demon dancers prowled along the edges of the stage, swaying as the bass bumped through the night. Green Velvet, Loco Dice B2B Nicole Moudaber, HI-LO (Oliver Heldens), Ida Engberg, Cirez D (Eric Prydz), and Drumcode label boss Adam Beyer mercilessly dished out beats over the weekend, entrancing all who dared stand before them.</p>\n<h2>Sanitarium: Dance Yourself Clean</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01213956/ESCAPE2021_1030_213914-9015_SCF-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The Sanitarium housed many of the most spine-tingling acts we brought this year for Escape Halloween. On Day 1, Basscon gave us a show that was just to die for, presenting a pestilent roster of names including Gammer HD, Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, Junkie Kid, and Mad Dog. On Day 2, we held Confession with Tchami and fell under the hypnotic spells of artists like Mark Knight, VNSSA, Lucati, and Sonny Fodera.</p>\n<h2>Crazy Town: Moonlit Metropolis</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/CVrtqWZF6J-/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

Grab a drink at the Crazy Town bar and watch the show at the flaming cathedral, sit for a spell at the gargoyle fountain, or dance on some graves over in the Raveyard while being treated to the silent disco. Beware of The Butcher, whose victims you will find crying for help amid a freezer full of hanging carcasses and dead human meat.</p>\n<p>For a more psychedelic experience, visit the Poison Ivy Bar to feast your eyes upon a backdrop marred by neon paint and black lights. Like a scene from an alternate reality version of Jumanji, a voracious, neon green man-eating plant towers in the center of the room, giving off toxic fumes and distorting your vision&#8230; or is that the diffraction glasses? We&#8217;ll never tell.</p>\n<p>At the bar you can find a host of hair-raising custom cocktails. Notable options include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Power of the Blue Moon (vodka, rum, gin, 7-Up, sour mix, and Blue Curacao)</li>\n<li>The Butcher&#8217;s Blood (vodka, soda, lime, raspberry liqueur)</li>\n<li>Alchemist Alibi (rum, pineapple)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Psycho Circus Area: Freaks Come Out to Play</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01230320/ESCAPE2021_1029_110141-7755_KKB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Adjacent to the Psycho Circus stage is the Psycho Circus-themed area, which offers a brief respite from the wicked atmosphere set by the music. The Psycho Circus contains creepy carnival attractions, including a Circus tent where talent and freak shows are performed all night long. Along the edges of Psycho Circus you can find tents inhabited by mystics performing tarot readings, palm readings, and fortune telling. You never know what you may learn about yourself along the way as you journey through this part of Escape.</p>\n<h2>VIP: A Supernatural Soirée</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01232408/ESCAPE2021_1030_182445-01631_IME-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Escape Halloween 2021: The Psycho Circus is Back\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The VIP experience at Escape Halloween provided an array of spooktacular exclusive amenities. All the perks could be found in the VIP area at The Grimm, with VIP viewing areas set up at other stages as well. VIP Headliners could visit the Bewitched Beauty Bar to add some sparkle to their Halloween attire, get a drink at the dedicated bar, and refill at the VIP free water station. Headliners were treated to exclusive food trucks, and the area also featured haunted photo ops and other attractions, including the Rave Name Tree.</p>\n<h2>Thank You for Helping to Resurrect Escape Halloween!</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CVr3SMsMQK1/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" data-instgrm-version=\"14\" style=\" background:#FFF;

In just a few months, the pandemic tore apart what many of us took for granted: health, time with loved ones, social interaction, and travel. For our community, that of course included the annual pilgrimage of hundreds of thousands of Headliners to the neon playground Under the Electric Sky at EDC Las Vegas. With dates twice moved when it was not yet safe for that reunion to happen, 17 months in the making, our community reconvened this past weekend for EDC Las Vegas with a unique aura in the air from a time longer than ever before spent waiting for such a moment.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, EDCLV did not disappoint, offering seemingly endless worlds within the speedway grounds, and just outside of it at Camp EDC. With a larger span than ever of its stages, more interactive art and hidden areas, and a plethora of unexpected surprises, EDC&#8217;s highlight reel was expansive. Take a journey with us through the best of EDC 2021.</p>\n<h2><strong>cosmicMEADOW: The Inaugural Communion</strong></h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27172914/EDCLV-2021_1022_065446-0711_TAA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Our opening ceremonies at Cosmic Meadow returned for the Headliners eager for that head-start into the festival. House grooves took us through the first couple hours and sunsets each day with sets from John Summit, SIDEPIECE, Blossom, and Z-Trip, plus two choice back-to-backs of Solardo B2B Vintage Culture, and Diplo B2B Lee Foss. Hosted by HARD, the stage offered a wide variety of sets from artists such as Said The Sky, Flosstradamus, AC Slater, Dabin, TOKiMONSTA, Zedd, a surprise appearance from Lil Nas X during Diplo&#8217;s Day 2 performance, and many more. cosmicMEADOW served as a mecca for Headliners during this very special edition of EDC, providing a sprawling field for rave families to reunite within.</p>\n<h2>kineticFIELD: A Place for Dreamers</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27175343/EDCLV2021_1024_042113-7803_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>kineticFIELD has long been considered the place where Headliners come together to experience all the joy and happiness EDC has to offer. However, this year felt different, with a renewed air of purpose surrounding the stage, cutting through the nostalgia and longing we all felt throughout the pandemic. Under the watchful gaze of the Insomniac Owl Guardians, ravers from all walks of life reunited once more beneath the Electric Sky to experience a state of kineticZEN, aided by our meditating goddesses watching over from either side of the stage. Set highlights throughout the weekend included the likes of Don Diablo, Seven Lions, Tiësto, DJ Snake (with a surprise visit from The Kid LAROI), Purple Disco Machine, and a staggering closing set by Slander B2B Said The Sky. We then bid farewell to our Headliners during the Closing Ceremony, looking forward to a bright new future for EDC 2022 and beyond.</p>\n<h2>circuitGROUNDS: Your Premier 360 Party Experience</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27183402/EDCLV212021_1023_221520-2493-MVA-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>circuitGROUNDS is back and better than ever!

Solid and complimentary colors form the basis of the lighting from the stage, while rotating spotlights keep in perfect time with the 4/4 beats. In addition, three rows of delay stacks line the tunnel to make sure you don’t miss a single beat. neonGARDEN kept it deep and dirty throughout the weekend with names like Michael Bibi and The Martinez Brothers, Eli Brown and Charlotte de Witte, and a killer Day 3 lineup featuring ARTBAT, Black Coffee, Nina Kraviz, Dubfire B3B Nicole Moudaber B3B Paco Osuna, with a jubilant closing set by Patrick Topping.</p>\n<h2>bassPOD: Where the Wild Things Are</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27193552/EDCLV2021_1022_231431-4J6A0756_JCM-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Bass lovers of all kinds come together at bassPOD to experience all the headbanging glory this stage has to offer.

As you walk beneath the Chasm art installation, taking the shape of the severed bust of a forlorn-looking woman, you enter a world unlike any other. The area presents itself as a desert punk sculpture garden, with photo ops galore and all manner of handcrafted figures made from recycled materials, reminding us that one person&#8217;s trash is often another&#8217;s treasure. With two dedicated bars, acrobats and performers fluttering about doing synchronized routines, an art car, the Double Decker, and Salvage City, this industrial park gone EDM is a must-see at EDC! When you are finished roaming around, exit out of the flatbed truck archway and head to kineticFIELD to see your next set!</p>\n<p>One new attraction from the 2021 edition of EDC is the Salvage City Meat Circus: EDC&#8217;s first-ever fine dining + performance experience! At this dystopian dinner party, you can dine in proper badlands style with your friends while getting a prime view of the Salvage City show. Experience a refined menu and signature handcrafted cocktails as you enjoy the show, and get a 360 birds-eye view of the festival from atop the building while watching the nomadic dancers atop the various structures throughout the area. More than worth the price, this is an immersive fine dining experience unlike any other. Inside the building, you&#8217;ll find flowers made out of recycled milk containers, industrial-era paintings on the walls, distressed interior design, and mismatched lighting fixtures; this is the stuff we only dream about in post-apocalyptic fiction come to life for you to experience firsthand!

Not only was this our first post-pandemic EDC, but it was also EDC&#8217;s 25 Year Anniversary. To celebrate, we decided to do a little extra on top of our usual nightly fireworks display. Counting down to the fireworks each night was a drone show that lit up the sky in various formations, including our Insomniac Owl, two humans coming together to signify our reunion Under The Electric Sky, and more! This was truly a sight to see in conjunction with our 25 Year fireworks display, and seemed like the perfect way to announce that we are back with a bang.</p>\n<h2>Pixel Forest and Coinbase NFT Gallery</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27230943/EDCLV2021-1022_212252-04335_EDS-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>Pixel Forest is one of many feats of engineering that exist throughout EDC. The tunnel through the structure is covered wall to wall in electric LED vines with bass bumping all throughout the space. Everywhere you look, you’ll find people vibing out, taking selfies, and just generally having a good time. Pixel Forest, with its rave cave aesthetic, is a place where nature-inspired architecture meets technology. Outside of the tunnel between the forest compound and neonGARDEN is an area filled with neon trees and hammocks for Headliners to hang around and listen to the music from.</p>\n<p>Another new fixture from this year is the Coinbase NFT Gallery. Offering free WiFi, the Coinbase NFT gallery is the future of blockchain art galleries. With a more linear feel to it than a regular art gallery, Coinbase is designed like a maze, but the walls are lined with screens playing unique EDC NFTs for auction or claiming. Notable pieces include EDC 25 Years: Under The Electric Sky, the Performer Highlight Reel, kineticFIELD AV NFT, animated EDC 2015 poster, Shuffling Eye Guy, and the Headliner Portrait Reel.</p>\n<h2>Allegiant Rave Terminal</h2>\n</div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-8 l-7\"><figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/27232722/EDCLV2021_1025_010432-9051_AGP-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited Under the Electric Sky: A Journey Through EDC Las Vegas 2021\"/></figure></div><div class=\"layout__block\" data-offset=\"l-1\" data-size=\"m-6 l-6\">\n<p>The rave doesn’t have to stop just because you want to chill for a bit!

      "fullContent": "<p>Now that the confetti has settled and most of us have retreated from the desert and made our best attempt to normalize back into society, it’s likely those post-EDC Las Vegas blues are starting to sink in. It’s natural. The three-day festival—weeklong, if you’re taking into account the dozens of EDC Week events and the ever-growing Camp EDC experience—becomes your home-away-from-home, in which you’re surrounded by a family of festival-goers, life-affirming vibrations, and an endless list of surprises scattered throughout the Speedway. It was an EDC for the history books, and there are many reasons why we will never forget it. And since we still can’t stop talking about it, we figured it would be fun to do so in our sizzle reel style that we like to call the Best of EDC Las Vegas.</p>\n<h2><strong>Record-Breaking Year </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231257/edclasvegas2019_bestofrecordbreaking_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nothing is more rewarding than that feeling when you bring in a new member into your inner circle. Our rave family is now a global phenom, as EDC Las Vegas drew in its biggest attendance in history as we officially took the title of being the largest dance music festival on the face of the Earth. Wow. And with that record-breaking headcount, the footprint opened up even more inside of the Speedway to welcome all of the wonderful new members of our international community.</p>\n<h2><strong>Camp EDC Kicks Off the Festivities</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232050/Ivan-Meneses-for-Insomniac-Events-6.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Most people might claim the fun starts on Friday, but that’s only if you’re not lumping yourself in with the thousands of eager-eyed revelers who made the right call to secure a spot at Camp EDC. With an expanded layout and upgrades implemented from top-to-bottom. To say version 2.0 was a step up from last year’s inaugural campground would be an understatement, and nearly double the amount of people came through this time to tack on a gang of extracurricular to their EDC experience. Three shaded structures had rotating programming that ranged from goat yoga, slack-lining tutorials, appointment-based salon seshes. Just a quick hop away were three giant pools side-by-side in case the mood called for a quick dip. And to top it all off, campers had their own personal pre- and post-parties each day, with the host honors going to Fisher’s Catch &amp; Release imprint, HARD, Insomniac Records, and Bassrush who were all tapped to program their own day of poolside slappers.</p>\n<h2><strong>Bill Nye Dropping Knowledge During Opening Ceremony</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231311/edclasvegas2019_bestofbillnye_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>You remember that super nice and smart dude from your childhood who made science class more fun than it should have ever been, right. Bill Nye was kind enough to help us roll out the kineticENERGY theme this year alongside Pasquale as they broke down the scientific meaning of energy and how it relates to our world. Well, he also helped the early birds of EDC get their nerd on during the opening ceremony, where he not only MCed like the boss he is, but also dropped just much needed knowledge about the dangers of climate change and reminded us that not keeping ourselves in check is certainly not the move here. Props to Bill Nye for keeping it real while urging everyone to smarten up.</p>\n<h2><strong>Plugging Into the kineticENERGY Theme</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232414/edclasvegas2019_bestofkineticenergy_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>The theme we mentioned up above truly came to life with this year’s kineticFIELD stage design, a futuristic mindfuckery that plugged into a fantasyland where man has melded with machine. Two adjacent cyborg faces watched over the dancefllor in opposing directions, meanwhile the circuitboard backdrops behind them housed sleek LEDs, gushing waterfalls, a grip of lasers, and enough pyro to level a mountain. Boom.</p>\n<h2><strong>Strolling Through the Scenes of Downtown EDC </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30232541/edclasvegas2019_bestofdowntownedc_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Propped over on the patch of grass near cosmicMEADOW used to be the wacky word of EDC Town. The immersive area was transformed into a hip metropolitan hangout, with a whole new look and feel that Yelpers would have checked into all weekend long. The neon-lit facades of its buildings piqued the curiosity of passerby to pop their heads inside to indulge in a slew of left-of-center spectacles including a throwback hip-hop club, a fully fab drag queen show, a cool karaoke club and a mini-bar shelling out tiny refreshments on the house.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crushing Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231251/edclasvegas2019_bestofcars_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Causing destruction might be the last thing on your mind when walking through the gates at EDC, but your tune might have changed if you wandered near wasteLAND and stumbled upon an art installation that invited you to crush cars with a robotic arm. Sign us up. One at a time, Headliners took turns climbing into a command post and put on a glove that was linked to a giant hand. This hand game them full control of a Hulk-sized robotic five-fingered appendage mirroring their every move. Within its reach was a small lot of abandoned cars that were rolled out and ready to get smashed to pieces. Seeing people throw out small gestures like a thumbs up and hand-horns was oddly just as satisfying of a sight.</p>\n<h2><b>Frolicking</b><strong> Through Pixel Forest </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231253/edclasvegas2019_bestofpixelforest_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>A few LED panels can really go a long way. Ask anyone who spent some time wandering around the Pixel Forest, a new immersive art exhibit that brought the potential of 8-bit lighting and design to life with an art installation that was essentially a mesmerizing lightshow that everyone was raving about all weekend long. Headliners were invited to enter a long, dark corridor where a mind-altering pattern of lights zoomed by in time with a score that sounded like you were zipping around the galaxy at lightspeed inside your own personal psychedelic spaceship. On top of this audiovisual trip, there were also the Icarus art decked out with video gaming consoles loaded with games like Super Smash Bros and other titles that made that corner of EDC feel like a true gamer’s getaway.</p>\n<h2><strong>Skrillex Sneaks Up on circuitGROUNDS </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231303/edclasvegas2019_bestofskrillex_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>One of the most asked questions we get from Headliners is “when is Skrillex going to come out of hiding.” Providing an answer has been damn near impossible, considering the OWSLA head honcho was adamant about keeping a low profile from the domestic festival circuit. He had been MIA from any EDC action for a hot minute, not counting the international appearances he made in Mexico and Japan. But after a sneaky Tweet from Pasquale on Saturday, speculation that Sonny would be one of the surprise guests for the night began to spread like wildfire. Those suspicions were confirmed at 10:30 pm when Skrill went ninja mode and hopped on the decks at circuitGROUNDS, in which he gave the dancefloor exactly what they’ve been begging for by banging out his latest bits like his remix of “Sicko Mode,” his JOYRYDE collab “Agen Wida,”and the VIP of “Face My Fears.” The secret must have gotten out quickly, because midway through his set, the turnout of the crowd was practically the size of a small city.</p>\n<h2><strong>Snuggling With the Newest Performer Troupe</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231313/edclasvegas2019_bestofperformers_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Interacting with the many troupes roving around the grounds of EDC could easily be a festival in and of itself. The colorful cast of characters on call throughout the weekend is the size of a small nation’s army, as hundreds of over-the-top performers dance, twirl, roleplay, summersault, jaunt, joke, and do all that is in their power to ensure every smiling soul they encounter is greeted with a good time. Almost any talent you can think of is being showcased with extreme skill, from tesla coil combat to high-flying trampoline stunts. Plopping around in the far less dangerous department of showmanship were the newest editions to the performer family this year were the Rainbow Rascals, a sleuth of wide-eyed, furry friends who paraded around offering snuggles to strangers in no short supply. Because who doesn’t like long and fuzzy hugs?</p>\n<h2><strong>Mobbing With A$AP Rocky</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231259/edclasvegas2019_bestofasaprocky_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>If you’ve ever found yourself at any of the HARD parties, you would know that the crew gets a kick out of bridging the gap between the worlds of dance music and hip-hop. They’ve spent the last decade or so putting heads up on the dopest names from both of those communities combined, and they’re roster at cosmicMEADOW was all the proof you need that they have their ear glued to the ground. Repping for the rap side of the spectrum this year was a riled-up appearance by ASAP Rocky, who didn’t waste any time ripping through his radio-ready hits like “Plain Jane,” “Praise the Lord,” and “Pick It Up” without skipping a beat. In a time where hip-hop is enjoying a massive resurgence, his set couldn’t have come at a better time.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>Skream and Rusko Take It Back at bassPOD</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30233357/edclasvegas2019_bestofskreamrusko_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Bassheads nowadays are always clamoring about how riddim is life, but that movement would have never been possible if it weren’t for the trailblazing efforts put in by the founding fathers of dubstep. Skream and Rusko were the original bricklayers of the genre back before the sounds splintered off into what we now know was rail-riding dubstep, and the pioneers agreed to host a history lesson for the young-ins by putting the b2b between their names and handle business on the old-school tip. It’s a move that has laid dormant for Skream, since the UK artist has been devoting his time to the house and techno streams. However, he rebooted the old project with his pal Rusko for an exclusive one-off that saw the pair kicking out classics such as “Midnight Request Line,” “Where’s My Money,” the bone-chilling remix of La Roux’s “In for the Kill” and more iconic cuts from their catalogs that put dubstep on the map in the first place.<strong> </strong></p>\n<h2><strong>ZHU Unleashes Both Aliases </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231250/edclasvegas2019_bestofzhu_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Nailing down your sound with one project is a challenge in itself, but juggling successful monikers at once is a job only few people can pull off. And it pays dividends when it does. Case in point: the smooth crooner known as ZHU, who touched down at EDC with two separate appearances spread across two nights. On Friday, he whipped out his Blacklizt alias at circuitGROUNDS with an hourlong performance that touched on the deeper, darker shades of his genius. He flipped the flavor back to what most of his fans are used to on Saturday at cosmicMEADOW, dressed in a custom outfit made from wristbands of his followers around the world while hammering out the sing-along staples such as “My Life” with Tame Impala, “In the Morning” and, naturally, the record responsible for blowing his profile up in the first place: “Faded.”</p>\n<h2><strong> </strong><strong>Synchronized Fireworks</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231301/edclasvegas2019_bestoffireworks_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>While the fireworks show at EDC puts every other one on the planet to shame—including the one happening nightly at the king of the theme parks—what it was lacking in comparison to the amusement park versions was the story being told by way of synching the explosions to a soundtrack. This year, we forwent the shock-and-awe approach to try our hand at a more unified version, which involved some crazy time-coding and pyrotechnic programming that is far more complicated than we have time to dive into here. What we can say, though, is there was a seven-minute set planned that used tracks like Chemical Brothers’ “We’ve Got to Try,” Moby’s “Thousand,” Charlotte de Witte’s remix of “Space Raiders,” Habstrakt’s “All Night” and many more blood-rushing records to create a story arc that played across every stage of the festival while the sequence of painstakingly timed fireworks lit up the sky in unison for the first time in EDC’s history. A technicolor milestone that took one of the most anticipated moments of the weekend to new heights.</p>\n<h2><strong>Crashing Art Cars </strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231307/edclasvegas2019_bestofartcar_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>Although smaller in stature compared to the official stages situated throughout the Speedway, the side parties popping off at Art Cars should never be overshadowed. These massive vehicles are not only a mini-rave on wheels, but they are also a strong source for people to dive into music discovery. There were virtually as many art cars as there were stages, and they were parked around the corner from any which point you might find yourself at the event. Insomniac Radio, mau5trap, UKR and Brownies &amp; Lemonade were a few of the hosts who curated their own respective nights, and when all was said and done, helped double the roster from EDC’s already stacked lineup. Some of the artists booked on one stage also trickled over to pop up for surprise sets, including Deorro, Kayzo, and Salvatore Ganacci. The beauty of these bonus appearances is the artists have the freedom to play an entirely different performance, like Alison Wonderland crashing the Parliament Art Car to throw down an all-house set that had heads jamming to an unexpected tempo.</p>\n<h2><strong>Cooling Off During the Closing Party at Camp EDC</strong></h2>\n<figure><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://d3vhc53cl8e8km.cloudfront.net/hello-staging/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/30231309/edclasvegas2019_bestofclosingparty_720.jpg\" alt=\"The Best of EDC Las Vegas 2019\"/></figure>\n<p>As the sun began to creep up over the horizon on the final day, the Meza was barely warming up for a closing party that allowed the campers to squeeze in some extra boogying before they had to head home. Solardo warmed up the space first, donning their signature floral button-up shirts as they gave the crowd a solid sunrise sendoff. Artbat and then Eli Brown took control, as the energy increasingly crept towards an afternoon delight. It was a nice way to cap off the biggest EDC Las Vegas to date, and presumably even more heads are doing to opt in for camping to help us close out the weekend next year.</p>\n<p><strong>Follow EDC Las Vegas on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/electricdaisycarnival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EDC_LasVegas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/edc_lasvegas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></strong></p>\n",

Next up, &#8216;Bal La Pista&#8217; delivers tight, loopy percussion with rasping basslines and gritty sound designs. There&#8217;s a menace in the air with paranoid vocals and sirens that will amp up the energy in the club. Closer, &#8216;Controller&#8217; leans into a funkier, hip-hop-inspired swagger.

Instead of doing a full breakdown, we focused this feature on one simple angle. We asked him to identify the single plugin that played the most important role in shaping the record. His reply gives a clear look at his workflow and the tools he leans on when building the melodic and textural elements that define his style.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cold-as-Snow-DAW-1024x427.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82424\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cold-as-Snow-DAW-1024x427.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cold-as-Snow-DAW-300x125.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cold-as-Snow-DAW-768x320.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cold-as-Snow-DAW-1536x640.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Cold-as-Snow-DAW-2048x854.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal was to keep the request focused so that the answer functions like a producer reference or a quick studio insight. His response also ties into the wider set of Native Instruments tools he works with on a regular basis, along with the synths and processing he uses to support guitars, reverb spaces, and low end. It is brief, but it gives producers enough detail to understand how one sound became a structural anchor in the track.</p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5KuU7DxFZtPwchzqdfodPc?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>The section below is his direct submission, presented as received. It captures the specific plugin choice that helped shape “Cold As Snow” and the decisions behind how he programmed and automated the part.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Seven Lion&#8217;s Favorite Plugin On &#8220;Cold As Snow&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-2025-11-14T121048.074-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82422\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-2025-11-14T121048.074-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-2025-11-14T121048.074-300x188.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-2025-11-14T121048.074-768x480.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-2025-11-14T121048.074-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design-2025-11-14T121048.074.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really hard picking one synth or plugin on this because there was a ton of different techniques used. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll just focus on the main sound in the break section as its the only real lead in the song. The plugin for that was Serum and the preset was from 7skies and it&#8217;s called <em>7 Seconds</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main thing about it is the amount of automation to make it stay really interesting because it repeats quite a bit. The sound starts out with a stereo panning effect and it slowly goes away and becomes more mono when it becomes the main sound.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shorten the decay quite a bit when it fully comes in as well so it feels like a rhythmic element that goes with the percusion. A few other MVPs for the track is the <a href=\"https://www.artsacoustic.com/artsacoustic_reverb.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arts Acoustic reverb</a> with the Temple preset. All the spaced out guitars have a ton of that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I use a lot of Omnisphere and <a href=\"https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/samplers/kontakt-8/?srsltid=AfmBOorMpDBRh4QhBYPHdajCvN6IHq0IR8l8vXAznHlb5k9y731DGcDp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kontakt</a> in here as well. One of my favorite things on the track is I double tracked a bass guitar and slightly distorted and hard panned them and it makes a pretty cool effect. The low end is all cut and replaced with a synth sub so its not stereo low end but I think it turned out great.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jeffs-Studio-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82423\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jeffs-Studio-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jeffs-Studio-300x225.jpg 300w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jeffs-Studio-768x576.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jeffs-Studio-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jeffs-Studio.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/seven-lions-favorite-plugin-for-shaping-cold-as-snow/\">Seven Lions’ Favorite Plugin for Shaping “Cold As Snow”</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

It follows a breakout year that saw him surpass a million Spotify streams, score a chart-topping track in Greece, land a song in the BBC Radio 2 rotation, and tour alongside Scouting for Girls and JC Stewart, all while gearing up for a headline run across the UK and Greece.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_198A9696_-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82197\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_198A9696_-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_198A9696_-200x300.jpg 200w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_198A9696_-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_198A9696_-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_198A9696_.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every release he&#8217;s put out this year has brought him further and further into the limelight. But with “Kids,” D3LTA hits a new creative peak: a song that captures both the numbness and the yearning of modern life. It&#8217;s as if he holds up a mirror held up to a generation trying to feel something real through all the noise. If you&#8217;re struggling with the state of today&#8217;s world and seeing constant bad news on your feed, then maybe, just maybe, this is the track you need in your life right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stream &#8220;Kids&#8221; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/4rXsgH2jWnhsKALJ0fjPME?si=uyITQ1QHT76QsJjb3vvgRA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/breakout-artist-d3lta-laments-growing-up-in-a-world-of-doomscrolling-on-kids/\">Breakout Artist D3LTA Laments Growing Up in a World of Doomscrolling on &#8220;Kids&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

Released on October 24, 2025, the single captures the moment you realize you’re slipping back into the very chaos you promised to leave behind, turning the uneasy dance between comfort and self-destruction into sound. “Sometimes we fall back into the very things we swore we’d outgrow,” Sabina says. “It’s messy, it’s human, and it’s honest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: Bad Habits\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1dwSwQX4KHVGYDFjTHC9Pu?si=5b902c7d898e4dab&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At just 22, Beyli already writes like someone twice her age : her lyrics cut deep, her melodies hit big, and her voice carries the emotional gravity of a confession whispered in a storm. “Bad Habits” blends alt-rock grit and pop clarity, nodding to Paramore and Evanescence while staying unmistakably her own: unflinchingly fierce, vulnerable, and real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyli’s music thrives in tension, the spaces between heartbreak and healing, quiet and chaos. Each song feels like a mirror for the listener’s own missteps and rebirths. After early praise from several outlets (which now includes ours), she’s fast becoming one of alt rock&#8217;s most fearless new voices.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_skirt_crouching_hi_res-768x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82205\" srcset=\"https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_skirt_crouching_hi_res-768x1025.jpg 768w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_skirt_crouching_hi_res-225x300.jpg 225w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_skirt_crouching_hi_res-1151x1536.jpg 1151w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_skirt_crouching_hi_res-1535x2048.jpg 1535w, https://magneticmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy_of_skirt_crouching_hi_res.jpg 1919w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If “Bad Habits” is any indication, Sabina Beyli isn’t interested in playing it safe. She’s building a catalogue of songs that bleed, shout, and heal, serving as proof that the most powerful stories come from the places we’re still learning to survive. To be able to do this at the young age of 22 is remarkable. We cannot wait to see where her career goes next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stream &#8220;Bad habits&#8221; <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/1dwSwQX4KHVGYDFjTHC9Pu?si=5b902c7d898e4dab\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com/2025/11/sabina-beyli-explores-the-vicious-cycle-on-new-single-bad-habits/\">Sabina Beyli Explores the Vicious Cycle on New Single &#8220;Bad Habits&#8221;</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://magneticmag.com\">Magnetic Magazine</a>.</p>\n",

Delia is a six-voice polyphonic synthesizer with four digital oscillators per voice, including virtual analogue, wavetable, and more; an analogue Ladder lowpass filter with both 2-pole and 4-pole slopes; a VA highpass filter; three LFOs and three envelopes; a mod matrix, stereo effects, and more.

Although the effects at the end of the signal chain are digital, the dual oscillators and filters are definitely analogue, with that Juno sound that electronic producers love so much. Unlike the original 106, though, this synth has two oscillators, meaning it's capable of fatter sounds than the original.

Arriving just a month after his last single, “Fennek,” Brejcha keeps his creative momentum in full throttle, pairing the release with a new music video that brings his desert-inspired vision to life. Another reminder that no one does high-tech minimal quite like Boris. <em>– Danielle Carty</em></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe data-testid=\"embed-iframe\" style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/2tj1iOLK9Uwef7ooLgJMtJ?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"352\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<iframe allow=\"autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *; clipboard-write\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"450\" style=\"width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;border-radius:10px;\" sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation\" src=\"https://embed.music.apple.com/us/playlist/zenith/pl.u-38oWMM4FPbPMamB\"></iframe>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured image: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iammaesic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Maesic</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com/2025/10/dancing-astronauts-new-music-friday-maesic-boris-brejcha-dimension-and-more-october-31-2025/\">Dancing Astronaut’s New Music Friday: Maesic, Boris Brejcha, Dimension, and more (October 31, 2025)</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://dancingastronaut.com\">Dancing Astronaut</a>.</p>\n",

The result is a dark yet uplifting journey that blends breakbeat-inspired drums, nostalgic synths, and a stuttered vocal lead. The track mirrors the stages of a mental breakdown — fracture, contemplation, and ultimately release — with harmonic shifts and lyrical drops guiding the listener through each phase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The concept of <em>“breakDown”</em> plays on multiple levels, from the breakbeat foundation, to the ‘breakdowns’ that counterbalance the drop, until the pre-drop vocal that urges listeners to break out into movement. To elevate its precision and energy, <strong>TATE SEDAR </strong>collaborated with <strong>Stephen Schroeder (SCHROEDS)</strong>, a producer and engineer celebrated for his work with <strong>Mary Droppinz </strong>and<strong> Paul Oakenfold</strong>. The outcome is a track that is at once pensive, dramatic, and undeniably danceable. With <em>“breakDOWN”</em> as his first Dim Mak release, the single proves his ability to constantly reinvent himself and dance music as an artist committed to pushing EDM into new territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>TATE SEDAR &#8211; breakDOWN | Stream below</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Spotify Embed: breakDOWN\" style=\"border-radius: 12px\" width=\"100%\" height=\"152\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/03e8YeECjMtZowmTryT1Rh?si=e190e4af6155476d&#038;utm_source=oembed\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n<p><a href='https://runthetrap.com/2025/11/14/listen-tate-sedar-breaks-his-own-rhythm-with-dim-mak-debut-on-new-noise-breakdown/'>'LISTEN: TATE SEDAR Breaks His Own Rhythm With Dim Mak Debut on New Noise: ‘breakDOWN’</a></p><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://runthetrap.com/2025/11/14/listen-tate-sedar-breaks-his-own-rhythm-with-dim-mak-debut-on-new-noise-breakdown/\">LISTEN: TATE SEDAR Breaks His Own Rhythm With Dim Mak Debut on New Noise: ‘breakDOWN’</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://runthetrap.com\">Run The Trap: The Best EDM, Hip Hop &amp; Trap Music</a>.</p>\n",

It’s an experiment in how artists can build interactive, automated, emotionally connected experiences on their own terms, without waiting for permission or a budget.&#8221;</em></strong></p>\n<cite><strong>Sound of Fractures</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As with every Sound of Fractures project, the music is just the beginning.. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His releases take on a world of their own and a wider purpose than a music release. With “Wanna Get Back”, Reddington aims to show the independent artist, the songwriter, the bedroom producer, that the gatekeepers of marketing your music creatively, such as budget, connections or skills, no longer exist. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now, artists can create worlds, games, incredible activations and new ideas.. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With cheap, easy-to-access and no-code tools..</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><em>“I didn’t hire anyone.I learned to make the game using AI-assisted tools like Cursor and Claude, building each part from scratch. At first, it was chaos. Broken leaderboards, looping emails, and characters that refused to move. But slowly, it came to life.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><em>I designed the pixel characters, generated the art and animations, pulled sound effects straight from the song’s stems, and set up automated systems that email players when they finish.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><em>By the end, I had a playable world that connected back to the music both sonically and emotionally.”</em></p>\n<cite><strong>Sound of Fractures</strong></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a prime example of how musicians in 2025 don’t need to be limited by constraints on creativity. Ten years ago, or even two years ago, creating a game to market your music was the reserve of big labels with big budgets and the ability to hire coders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, from the ground up, artists can create worlds that push beyond the cut-and-paste release schedule. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the Sound of Fractures ethos and the objective of “Wanna Get Back”</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <a href=\"https://s.disco.ac/hikkjwtqoppa\"><strong>Listen/Download</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/soundcloud%253Atracks%253A2196082255&#038;color=%23f500ba&#038;auto_play=false&#038;hide_related=false&#038;show_comments=true&#038;show_user=true&#038;show_reposts=false&#038;show_teaser=true\"></iframe><div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/soundoffractures\" title=\"Sound of Fractures\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">Sound of Fractures</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/soundoffractures/i-wanna-get-back\" title=\"I Wanna Get Back\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\">I Wanna Get Back</a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://datatransmission.co/news/sound-of-fractures-drops-new-single-with-a-playable-game/\">Sound of Fractures drops new Single with a Playable Game</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://datatransmission.co\">Data Transmission</a>.</p>\n",
