# Beads Issue Tracking Integration

## 🚨 MANDATORY PROTOCOL

All agents MUST use Beads (`bd`) for task and issue management. This replaces markdown files, TODOs, and in-context planning.

## Session Startup (REQUIRED)

**Before ANY work, the agent MUST:**

1. Query ready work: `bd ready --json`
2. Review project health: `bd stats`
3. Check blocked issues: `bd blocked --json`
4. Select work from ready issues (never start blocked work)

**Example session start:**
```bash
# Check what work is available
READY_WORK=$(bd ready --json)
echo "Available work: $READY_WORK"

# Review project status
bd stats

# Check for blockers
BLOCKED=$(bd blocked --json)
if [ -n "$BLOCKED" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Blocked issues detected: $BLOCKED"
fi
```

## Workflow Rules

### Starting Work

**When beginning ANY task:**

1. **If work comes from Beads**:
   - Update status: `bd update <id> --status in_progress --json`
   - Use `bd show <id> --json` to get full context

2. **If work is NEW**:
   - Create issue first: `bd create "Task title" -d "Description" -p 1 -t task --json`
   - Then update status: `bd update <id> --status in_progress --json`

### During Development

**As you work, you MUST:**

- **File issues for discovered problems**:
  ```bash
  NEW_ISSUE=$(bd create "Bug: <description>" -t bug -p 0 --json)
  bd dep add <new-id> <parent-id> --type discovered-from
  ```

- **Add labels for organization**:
  ```bash
  bd label add <id> backend,urgent
  ```

- **Link related work**:
  ```bash
  bd dep add <dep-id> <related-id> --type related
  ```

### Completing Work

**When finishing ANY task:**

1. **Close with reason**:
   ```bash
   bd close <id> --reason "Implemented feature X with tests. Verified with npm test." --json
   ```

2. **Check if dependencies are resolved**:
   ```bash
   # Check if closing this unblocks other issues
   bd ready --json
   ```

3. **Update related issues** if completing work affects them

## Integration with Protocol Check

**Combine Beads workflow with mandatory protocol check:**

```
🚨 MANDATORY PROTOCOL CHECK:
1. AM I ON FEATURE BRANCH? [YES/NO]
2. DO I HAVE USER APPROVAL? [YES/NO]
3. AM I DEPLOYING TO STAGING FIRST? [YES/NO]
4. HAVE I QUERIED BEADS FOR READY WORK? [YES/NO]
5. HAVE I UPDATED ISSUE STATUS TO IN_PROGRESS? [YES/NO]
```

## Critical Rules

- ✅ **ALWAYS use `--json` flag** - Required for programmatic access
- ✅ **File issues instead of storing plans in context** - Solves amnesia problem
- ✅ **Automatically file issues** for problems noticed during work
- ✅ **Link discovered work** back to parent issues with `discovered-from`
- ✅ **Never start blocked work** - Always check `bd ready --json` first
- ✅ **Update status immediately** when starting/stopping work
- ✅ **Close with detailed reasons** - Include what was accomplished and how it was verified

## Dependency Types

Use appropriate dependency types:

- **`blocks`**: Hard blocker - work cannot start until blocker resolved
- **`related`**: Soft relationship - issues connected but not blocking
- **`parent-child`**: Hierarchical relationship
- **`discovered-from`**: Issue discovered during work on another issue

## Error Handling

**If `bd` command fails:**

1. Check if `bd` is installed: `which bd`
2. Verify PATH includes Go bin: `echo $PATH | grep go/bin`
3. Check `.beads/` directory exists
4. If `bd` unavailable, **document the work that should be filed** and file it when `bd` is available

**Never skip Beads workflow** - If `bd` is unavailable, note what issues should be created and create them as soon as `bd` is available.

## Memory and Context Management

**Beads solves agent amnesia:**

- All plans → Beads issues (not in context)
- All discovered work → Beads issues (not forgotten)
- All task status → Beads status (persistent)
- All dependencies → Beads dependencies (visible)

**This frees context for actual code and implementation details.**

## Multi-Agent Coordination

Because Beads syncs through Git:

- Multiple agents can work on same project
- `.beads/issues.jsonl` syncs via git
- Each agent queries `bd ready --json` to avoid conflicts
- Dependencies prevent blocking conflicts

## Examples

### Starting Session
```bash
# 1. Check ready work
READY=$(bd ready --json | jq -r '.[0].id')
echo "Starting work on: $READY"

# 2. Update status
bd update $READY --status in_progress --json

# 3. Get full context
bd show $READY --json | jq
```

### Discovering Bug During Work
```bash
# Create issue for discovered bug
BUG_ID=$(bd create "Auth endpoint returns 500 on invalid token" -t bug -p 0 --json | jq -r '.id')

# Link to current work
CURRENT_ID="bd-42"
bd dep add $BUG_ID $CURRENT_ID --type discovered-from

# Add labels
bd label add $BUG_ID auth,backend,urgent
```

### Completing Work
```bash
# Close with reason
bd close bd-42 --reason "Fixed auth endpoint validation. Added tests in auth.test.ts. Verified with npm test. Resolves bd-42." --json

# Check for newly unblocked work
bd ready --json
```

## Task Lists Integration

**To convert a tasklist.md file to Beads issues:**

```bash
# Convert all unchecked items to Beads issues
./scripts/tasklist-to-beads.sh tasklist.md

# Link to a parent issue
./scripts/tasklist-to-beads.sh tasklist.md bd-42
```

**When working with task lists:**
- Read `tasklist.md` and convert unchecked items to Beads issues
- Use parent-child dependencies to group related tasks
- Check off items in tasklist.md as you complete Beads issues
- The script skips items that already exist in Beads

## Project Analysis & Setup

**To analyze project goals/features and generate tasks:**

```bash
# Analyze specific files/directories
./scripts/analyze-project-goals.sh goals.md features.md

# Auto-detect and analyze
./scripts/analyze-project-goals.sh

# Verify tasks before converting
./scripts/verify-tasks.sh tasklist.md
```

**Complete project setup (cleanup + analyze + verify):**

```bash
# Full setup with verification
./scripts/project-setup.sh [goals-file] [features-file]

# Or step by step:
./scripts/cleanup-repo.sh --dry-run        # Review cleanup
./scripts/check-updates.sh                # Check recent changes
./scripts/analyze-project-goals.sh         # Generate tasks
./scripts/verify-tasks.sh tasklist.md     # Verify before Beads
```

**When user asks to analyze goals/features:**
1. Run `./scripts/analyze-project-goals.sh` with provided files/dirs
2. Review generated `tasklist.md`
3. Run `./scripts/verify-tasks.sh tasklist.md` to show user
4. Wait for user confirmation before converting to Beads
5. Convert with `./scripts/tasklist-to-beads.sh tasklist.md`

## Enforcement

**Agents MUST:**
- Query Beads at session start
- File issues for discovered work
- Update status when starting/stopping work
- Close with detailed reasons
- Use `--json` flag always
- Convert tasklist.md files to Beads issues when encountered

**Violations:**
- Starting work without querying `bd ready --json` = Block and redirect
- Not filing issues for discovered problems = Create issue automatically
- Not updating status = Update status automatically when detected
- Not using `--json` = Re-run command with `--json` flag
