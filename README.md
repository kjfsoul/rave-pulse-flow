# EDM Shuffle

Welcome to **EDM Shuffle** ‚Äî the next-gen community-driven digital rave and festival platform.  
This project is an open, transparent, and rigorously documented codebase, built with a focus on trust, verifiability, and collaboration across leading AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Roo Code, and more).

## üöÄ What is EDM Shuffle?

EDM Shuffle is a festival-inspired, interactive audio/visual experience for DJs, shufflers, and festival fans. The platform includes:

- Real-time DJ Mix Station with dual decks and authentic Web Audio API features
- Live Festival Voting Stage for audience-driven lineups
- Crowd engagement: Confetti bursts, emoji reactions, and interactive challenges
- Dynamic Rave Marketplace (fashion, gear, and more)
- Community leaderboard, PLUR power, and archetype-based game mechanics
- Extensible for virtual events, merch drops, and user submissions

## üîç Repository Structure

- **All documentation is located in the root directory of this repo.**  
- Major source code lives under `/src/`, with components, pages, and hooks logically organized.

## üìÇ Documentation Index

See [`DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`](./DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md) for a full, clickable list with descriptions.

**Key Docs in Root Directory:**

- `README.md` (this file)
- `CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md`
- `IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md`
- `PRD.md` (Product Requirements)
- `FRS.md` (Functional Requirements)
- `MASTERPLAN.md` (Strategic Project Roadmap)
- `AUDIO_UI_COMPONENTS.md`
- `claudeupdate.md`
- _...plus other live docs as they are created (see index)_

## üõ†Ô∏è Contributing

- **Strictly adhere to** `CLAUDE_INTEGRITY_RULES.md` (no placeholder code, no fabricated claims).
- **Work on one microtask at a time, in order, as defined in `IMPLEMENTATION_MICROTASKS.md`.**
- Use `claudeupdate.md` for reporting progress and issues.
- If blocked, escalate to human or next AI assistant as noted in the rules.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS
- Web Audio API
- Supabase (planned)
- Open, extensible for cloud/AI integrations (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Roo Code, Kimi Dev, etc.)

## üéØ Core Principles

- **Transparency:** Every commit, feature, and claim must be verifiable.
- **Modularity:** Components and features are built independently and composably.
- **Community-Driven:** Prioritizing user engagement, feedback, and collective energy.
