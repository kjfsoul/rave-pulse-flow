## 4. Automated Workflow Optimizations

### Plan Mode + Ultrathink Strategy
```markdown
When encountering complex problems:

1. **ALWAYS** use ultrathink + Plan Mode combination
2. **REV THE ENGINE**: Perform multiple critique rounds
3. **SPLIT ROLE SUB-AGENTS**: Use multiple perspectives:
   - Security expert perspective
   - Performance optimization perspective  
   - User experience perspective
   - Code architecture perspective
   - Testing and QA perspective

4. **VALIDATE ASSUMPTIONS** before execution
5. **CREATE SAFETY NETS** with comprehensive tests
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
```markdown
For complex features requiring parallel work:

1. **CREATE GIT WORKTREES** for isolated development
2. **SPAWN SUB-AGENTS** for parallel tasks:
   - Research agents for documentation/APIs
   - Implementation agents for different features
   - Testing agents for validation
   - Integration agents for connecting components

3. **COORDINATE THROUGH SHARED FILES**:
   - Update coms.md with agent communications
   - Maintain shared task status in tasks.md
   - Log progress in session summaries

4. **MERGE SYSTEMATICALLY** with conflict resolution
```

### Context Management Rules
```markdown
CRITICAL CONTEXT RULES:

1. **NEVER USE /compact** - Instead:
   - Summarize work to markdown file
   - Clear context with /clear
   - Reference summary when continuing

2. **MAINTAIN SCOPE CONTEXT**:
   - Provide exact file paths
   - Reference specific functions/components
   - Include relevant code snippets

3. **OPTIMIZE TOKEN USAGE**:
   - Strip unnecessary comments when analyzing
   - Focus on specific areas of change
   - Use targeted edits rather than full rewrites
```

## 5. Quality Assurance Automation

### Automated Testing Strategy
```markdown
Testing Requirements:

1. **UNIT TESTS**: Generate for all business logic
2. **INTEGRATION TESTS**: API endpoints and data flows
3. **E2E TESTS**: Critical user journeys
4. **ACCESSIBILITY TESTS**: Screen reader compatibility
5. **PERFORMANCE TESTS**: Load and rendering metrics

Test Generation Rules:
- Cover happy paths, edge cases, and error conditions
- Include realistic test data generation
- Validate both positive and negative scenarios
- Test with various user roles and permissions
```

### Linting & Code Quality
```markdown
Automated Quality Checks:

1. **TYPESCRIPT VALIDATION**: Before any commit
2. **ESLINT RULES**: Code style and best practices
3. **PRETTIER FORMATTING**: Consistent code formatting
4. **SECURITY SCANNING**: Vulnerability detection
5. **PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS**: Bundle size and optimization

Integration with hooks ensures automatic execution.
```

## 6. AI Integration Best Practices

### Structured AI Outputs
```markdown
For AI-powered features:

1. **USE PYDANTIC AI** for validated outputs
2. **DEFINE CLEAR SCHEMAS** for AI responses
3. **IMPLEMENT FALLBACK STRATEGIES** for AI failures
4. **CACHE EXPENSIVE AI OPERATIONS**
5. **MONITOR AI USAGE AND COSTS**

Example schema enforcement:
- Message generation with length/tone constraints
- Image generation with specific dimensions/styles
- Data analysis with structured result formats
```

### Error Handling & Resilience
```markdown
AI Integration Resilience:

1. **GRACEFUL DEGRADATION**: Apps work without AI
2. **RETRY LOGIC**: Handle temporary AI service failures
3. **RATE LIMITING**: Respect AI service quotas
4. **COST MONITORING**: Track token usage and expenses
5. **USER FEEDBACK**: Allow manual override of AI decisions
```
