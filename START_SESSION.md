# START NEW CURSOR SESSION

## What to Say When You Open Cursor

**Copy and paste this into the chat:**

```
Initialize session: run memory check, load Beads context, validate session file, check for secrets. Output all status blocks.
```

## What Cursor Should Output

```
🧠 Memory Check: ✅ HEALTHY
📅 Session: 2025-11-04
📋 Current Work: bd-42 - Implement feature X
✅ Session initialized
📚 Context loaded: 3 commits today, working in backend, frontend
🔐 Security: ✅ CLEAN
```

## If It Doesn't Work

Try this shorter version:

```
Run ./scripts/integrated-session-start.sh and show me the output
```

Then tell Cursor what you see.
